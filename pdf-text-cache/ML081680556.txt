is summarized below. 
Opening Remarks 
Mr. Bonaca, Chairman of the Plant License Renewal Subcommittee, convened the meeting and 
made a few introductory remarks. The purpose 
of this meeting is to review Entergy's license 
renewal application (LRA) and the related Draft Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for Arkansas 
Nuclear One, Unit 2 
(AN02). Mr. Bonaca called upon Mr. Kuo of the Office of Nuclear Reactor 
Regulation (NRR) to begin the discussion. 
Staff Introduction 
Mr. Kuo introduced several members of the staff including Mr. Suber (license renewal program 
manager), Ms. Nease (inspection team leader), and Mr. Cranston (audit team leader). Mr. Kuo also 
noted that 
AN02 is  the second plant to be reviewed with a new process that uses on-site audits 
to verify consistency with the Generic Aging Lessons Learned Report (GALL). 
AN02 License Renewal Application 
Mr. Young, Entergy, greeted the Subcommittee and introduced accompanying members of the 
Entergy and AREVA staff. The key elements 
of Mr. Young's presentation included a 
description 
of AN02, its operating history, the scoping methodology, the application of GALL, 
and commitment tracking. 
Background and Plant Description 
On October 15, 2003, Entergy submitted 
an application to the NRC for renewal of the AN02 
operating license for an additional 20 years. The current operating license for AN02 expires on 
July 17, 2018. Entergy also identified staff approved past precedents that are not in GALL and 
provided this information to the staff. 
2
 

AN02 is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) unit with a dry ambient containment. AN02 began
 
initial operations 
in 1978 and has a capacity of 3026 MWt or 1023 MWe. Mr. Young also noted
 
some differences between 
ANa Unit 1 and 2. Unit 1 is a Babcock and Wilcox PWR that uses
 
once through cooling, while Unit 2 is  a Combustion Engineering PWR with a cooling tower.
 
Operating Historv/Major Equipment Replacements and Repairs
 
In 2002, a power uprate of 7.5% increased capacity by 210 MWe. In 2000 the steam
 
generators were replaced with Westinghouse Delta 109 U-tube steam generators.
 
Scoping and Screening Method
 
The scoping methodology was applied on a plant system basis per the requirements of 10 CFR
 
54.4(a) and screening was performed per the requirements 
of 10 CFR 54.21 (a)1. Mr. Young
 
added that 
all components located in a room that contains both safety and non-safety related
 
equipment were assumed to be 
in scope.
 
Application 
of GALL
 
The 
AN02 license renewal application focused on consistency with GALL but since some
 
material/environment/program combinations were not addressed 
in GALL some plant-specific
 
programs were used. 
Mr. Young stated that information from Entergy's past precedent review
 
was provided separately from the LRA. This information is  being considered by the staff 
in an
 
update of the GALL report.
 
Of the 33 aging management programs (AMPs) at AN02, 15 are consistent with GALL with
 
enhancements, 7 are consistent with GALL with exceptions, and 
11 are plant-specific. Of the
 
11 plant-specific programs, 8 are based on past precedents. Mr. Young stated that the One­

Time Inspection Program was added after the LRA was submitted.
 
Commitment Tracking
 
Mr. Young stated that all commitments made through the LRA, the audit/inspection process,
 
and requests for additional information are tracked with the ANO Licensing Commitment
 
Tracking System.
 
Mr. Young concluded by stating that the use of past precedents and the on-site audits increase
 
the efficiency of the license renewal process.
 
SER Overview 
Mr. Suber discussed the staff's license renewal activities. The key elements of the staff's 
presentation described 
an overview of the Draft SER, the aging management program reviews 
and audits, and the time-limited aging analyses. 
The Draft SER did not contain any open or confirmatory items but did list the following license 
conditions: 
1.  The FSAR should be updated upon issuance of the renewed license. 
2.  The future activities should be completed as described in the FSAR Supplement prior to 
entering the period 
of extended operation. 
3
 

3.  The reactor vessel surveillance capsules should be removed and tested in accordance 
with ASTM E185-82 and any changes 
to the withdrawal schedule or storage 
requirements should be approved by the NRC. 
Mr. Suber listed the dates of the various audits and inspections performed by the staff. 
Scoping and Screening 
Mr. Suber stated that the scoping and screening methodology is  adequately described in the 
LRA and satisfies the requirements 
in 10 CFR 54.4 and 10 CFR 54.21 (a)(1). In addition, the 
review of the scoping and screening results found that the systems, structures, and 
components (SSCs) within scope of license renewal and subject to 
an aging management 
review (AMR) have been identified. As a result of the staff's review, the feedwater outboard 
block valve and the power transmission conductors were brought into scope, and the intake 
canal structure was included 
in an aging management program. 
Onsite Inspection Results 
Ms. Nease, Region IV, described the license renewal inspections performed by the Region. 
These inspections were performed 
in accordance with License Renewal Manual Chapter 
MC2516, Inspection Procedure IP 71002, and a site-specific inspection plan. The scoping and 
screening inspection was performed 
in March 2004 and concluded that the scoping and 
screening process successfully identified those SSCs requiring 
an AMR. As a result of this 
inspection the spent fuel pool cooling pumps and the switchyard control house were brought 
into scope of license renewal. The aging management review inspection was performed 
in 
November 2004 to confirm that the applicant has or will implement AMPs to manage the effects 
of aging. The results of this inspection will be documented 
in a future inspection report. 
Ms. Nease also described the recent performance of AN02. All of the NRC performance 
indicators for the third quarter of 2004 are green. However, 
AN02 is in the Regulatory 
Response Column 
of the NRC Action Matrix because of a white finding in the area of fire 
protection. 
Ms. Nease concluded by stating that the Annual Assessment Letter for AN02 
identified a substantive issue regarding Problem Identification and Resolution. 
Aging Management Program Review and Audits 
Mr. Suber described the staff's review of the aging effects associated with various plant 
systems and components. The staff's review of the reactor vessel, internals and reactor 
coolant systems resulted 
in 1 license condition and 3 commitments to submit AMPs for NRC 
review and approval. As a result of the staff's review the One-Time Inspection Program was 
added to supplement the System Walkdown AMP and the intake canal structure was included 
in the Structures Monitoring Program. Even though the pH, chloride and sulfate levels of the 
below grade water environment are nonaggressive, the Structures Monitoring Program will be 
used to manage the effects 
of aging of inaccessible concrete. Mr. Suber also noted that the 
power transmission conductors which were brought 
in scope as a result of the staff's review, did 
not require 
an AMP. 
Mr. Cranston, NRR, stated that AMPs are divided into 4 categories: consistent with GALL, 
consistent with GALL with exceptions, consistent with GALL with enhancements, and based 
on 
previously approved staff positions. Mr. Cranston also noted that information regarding NRC 
approved precedents was supplementary information provided voluntarily by the applicant. It 
4
 

was not part of the LRA. For the AMPs based on past precedents, the audit team evaluated the 
applicability of the previously approved staff position, determined if the program was bounded 
by the conditions for which the previous staff position was approved, and verified that the 
program contains the attributes of the referenced precedent. 
Mr. Cranston described several of 
the AMPs including the Structures Monitoring - Masonry Wall Program, the Diesel Fuel 
Monitoring Program, the Fire Water System Program, and the Cast Austenitic Stainless Steel 
Evaluation Program. 
The Structures Monitoring - Masonry Wall Program is  an existing AMP that is  consistent with 
GALL. During the audit of this AMP, the team found that the initial baseline examinations were 
not documented properly, the first 5 year reexamination was not performed, and qualifications 
for personnel qualified to perform walkdowns were not established. The applicant generated a 
condition report to document and correct these deficiencies. 
The Diesel Fuel Monitoring Program is  new AMP that is  consistent with GALL with exceptions. 
The exceptions are the use of fewer additives, the use of ASTM standard D 1796 instead of D 
2709, the use of a smaller filter pore size, and a lack of ultrasonic measurements of tank 
bottoms. The staff found these exceptions acceptable because a vendor recommended 
additive package was used, ASTM D2709 did not apply, the smaller pore size is  more 
conservative, the bottom of the tank is  not likely to 
be exposed to water, accessible tank 
surfaces undergo a periodic visual inspection, and operating experience at 
AN02 has not 
shown any wall thinning problems. 
The Fire Water System is 
an example of an AMP that is consistent with GALL with 
enhancements. The program enhancement is  to inspect sprinkler heads consistent with Interim 
Staff Guidance (ISG) 04. 
The Cast Austenitic Stainless Steel (CASS) Evaluation Program was originally submitted based 
on a previously approved staff position but was changed to 
be consistent with GALL. The audit 
team determined that the code case to perform only external visual inspections was not 
applicable to 
AN02. Therefore, the applicant revised the AMP to be consistent with GALL. An 
example of a plant-specific AMP based 
on a previously approved staff position is the Wall 
Thinning Monitoring Program. This AMP was previously approved by the staff for 
AN01. 
The staff concluded that the applicant has demonstrated the effects of aging will be managed 
so that the intended functions will be maintained consistent with the current licensing basis for 
the period of extended operation. 
Time Limited Aging Analyses (TLAAs) 
Mr. Suber stated that the applicant has identified the appropriate TLAAs. Of the 11 TLAAs at 
AN02, 5 were identified from NUREG 1800 and 6 were identified by the applicant. The 
applicant has also demonstrated that (1) the TLAAs are valid for the period of extended 
operation, (2) the TLAAs are projected to the end of the period of extended operation, or (3) 
that aging effects will be adequately managed for the period of extended operation. 
Embrittlement of the reactor vessel affects TLAAs associated with upper shelf energy (USE), 
pressurized thermal shock (PTS), and pressure temperature limits. Calculations by the staff 
and applicant demonstrate that the beltline materials continue to meet the USE acceptance 
5
 

criterion in 10 CFR 50 Appendix G through 48 Effective Full Power Years (EFPY). The staff 
also performed independent calculations of RT
PTS values and concluded that the limiting beltline 
material continues to meet the screening criterion 
in 10 CFR 50.61 through 48 EFPY. 
The staff concluded that analyses associated with fatigue of ASME Class 1 components; 
fatigue of ASME Non-Class 1 piping components; fatigue of containment liner plate and 
penetrations; fracture of reactor coolant pump casings, and Leak-Before-Break of RCS piping 
systems remain valid for the period of extended operation. 
The staff made the following conclusions regarding the other TLAAs: 
1.  The loss of prestress in containment tendons will be adequately managed for the 
extended period of operation. 
2.  The Environmental Qualification Program is consistent with GALL and will continue to 
manage equipment 
in accordance with 10 CFR 50.49. 
3.  The analyses of Alloy 600 nozzle repairs projected through the period of extended 
operation are valid. 
Mr. Suber concluded by stating that the applicant has met the requirements for license renewal 
and there is reasonable assurance that activities will continue to be conducted 
in the renewal 
term 
in accordance with the current licensing basis. 
Member Comments 
General 
Chairman Bonaca and Member Rosen asked about the replacement steam generators. 
Mr. 
Young replied that the replacement steam generators were of the same design as the original 
steam generators but were designed for a higher power rating and contained tube materials 
constructed from Alloy 690. 
Several Members and Consultant Leitch asked questions regarding the reactor pressure vessel 
head. The applicant stated that 
an inspection of the head in 2002 did not indicate any leakage 
even though 
AN02 is  a high susceptibility plant. Since some of the penetrations are covered 
by a shroud which prevents a complete 360
0 
bare metal visual inspection, alternative eddy 
current and ultrasonic inspections were performed. The results 
of these volumetric inspections 
did not show any cracking. The applicant has plans to replace the head, but the earliest this 
could 
be done is  2008. In the meantime the applicant plans to modify the shroud covering the 
penetrations to allow increased access for visual inspections. 
In response to a question from Consultant Leitch, Ms. Nease stated that the material condition 
of the plant was very good. 
Chairman Bonaca and Member Rosen asked about the issue identified 
in the Annual 
Assessment Letter regarding Problem Identification and Resolution. Ms. Nease responded that 
errors 
in the prioritization, implementation, and effectiveness of corrective actions were found 
across the board at the plant. This is  a concern because AMPs depend upon the effectiveness 
of the Corrective Action Program. 
6
 

Chairman Bonaca and Member Wallis commented that the audit report for AMPs and AMRs is 
very valuable to reviewers. 
Several Members commented that there are 
no issues regarding the AN02 license renewal 
application or draft SER. 
Scoping and Screening 
Several Members and Consultant Leitch asked questions regarding the justification for the 
scoping and screening classification of components. 
In response to a question from Consultant Leitch, the applicant stated that there were no 
problems associated with the scoping of systems shared between Units 1 and 
2. 
Consultant Leitch asked if the scoping process considers situations in which the disintegration 
of non safety-related components affects the operation of safety-related components. Except 
for steam dryers 
in BWRs, operating experience has shown that this type of interaction has not 
been a problem. The staff added that active components are examined routinely as part of the 
maintenance program. 
Aging Management 
Consultant Leitch asked why buried components are inspected opportunistically and not at a 
scheduled frequency as recommended by GALL. 
Mr. Young replied that operating experience 
has shown that underground pipes are excavated every 5 to 
10 years and inspected at that 
time. 
Mr. Young added that excavating a pipe has the potential to damage its external coating. 
In response to a question from Member Sieber, the applicant stated that no inspections are 
performed 
on the inside of buried pipes because other AMPs are credited for managing 
corrosion 
on these interior surfaces. 
Consultant Leitch asked about the schedule for implementing new AMPs and suggested that 
this information be discussed at the Full Committee meeting. The applicant stated that the new 
AMPs will 
be phased in such that they will all be in place at least 2 years before the 40
th 
year of 
operation. A detailed implementation schedule will be developed after the renewed license has 
been issued. 
Several Members asked questions regarding the staff's review of the quality of the AMPs. The 
headquarters staff and audit team assess the quality of the programs while the regional 
inspection team verifies that the programs are implemented as described. 
In determining the 
effectiveness of current AMPs, the staff considers operating experience, performs walkdowns, 
and examines Condition Reports. 
Member Ford asked about the inspection program for reactor vessel internals. The staff 
responded that the reactor vessel internals programs have not been finalized but the applicant 
has committed to submitting these programs for staff review 2 years before entering the period 
of extended operation. 
Member Ford asked if corrosion 
of carbon steel pipes could clog up the nozzles in the fire 
protection systems. The applicant responded that if this clogging occurred, it would be 
identified during the periodic flushing performed as part of the AMP for the fire protection 
systems. 
7
 

Members Ford and Rosen asked about the aging management of inaccessible concrete. The 
most recent tests 
of groundwater chemistry indicate that the below grade environment is  not 
aggressive. Since well water is  no longer available for periodic monitoring, the applicant chose 
to use the Structures Monitoring Program to manage the effects 
of aging. Under this program 
concrete exposed to lakewater will 
be periodically inspected. Since the chemistry of lakewater 
and ground water are similar, these inspection results will 
be representative of underground 
concrete exposed to groundwater. 
Member Rosen asked if the root cause of the discrepancies 
in the Structures Monitoring ­
Masonry Wall Program was identified. The applicant stated that some 
of these discrepancies 
were simply the result 
of the wrong date used in determining the time for the next inspection. 
TLAAs 
The TLAAs for reactor vessel embrittlement assumed a constant capacity factor of 80% for 60 
years resulting 
in 48 EFPY. Consultant Leitch and Member Rosen questioned the basis for this 
assumption and asked if the USE and PTS requirements could still be met at 
54 EFPY. The 
applicant stated that the basis for this assumption was that the LRA for 
AN01 assumed 48 
EFPY and that operating experience to date has shown 
an 80% capacity factor for AN02. The 
staff stated that at 54 EFPY the RT
PTS value for the limiting beltline material increases by only 2 
degrees and would continue to meet the PTS screening criterion. The staff added that the 
Reactor Vessel Integrity Program will ensure that fluence values are updated as needed. 
Several Members and Consultant Leitch asked why cumulative usage factors greater than 1 are 
acceptable for some components. The staff stated that these analyses are conservative and 
the actual number of cycles are much lower than those used 
in these analyses. The staff 
added that if the usage factor of a component exceeds 
1, the licensee would have to repair the 
component, replace the component, refine the analysis, or implement an aging management 
program. The applicant added that fatigue calculations are updated every fuel cycle to verify 
that cumulative usage factors won't exceed 1 during the next cycle. 
Member Wallis asked what data was used to analyze the loss of prestress 
in concrete 
containment tendons. The applicant stated that data from the containment of AN01 was 
extrapolated to 60 years and is  above the minimum requirements. 
Staff Commitments 
The staff will calculate the USE of the limiting beltline material at 54 EFPY and report the 
results to the Committee.

activities that are inherently 
governmental. 
SUMMARY: In accordance with the 
"Federal Activities Inventory Reform 
Act of 1998" (Pub. L. 105-270) ("FAIR 
Act"), agency inventories of activities 
FIRST 
FAIR ACT RELEASE 2004 
that are not inherently governmental are 
now available to the public from the 
agencies listed below. The FAIR Act 
requires that OMB publish an 
announcement of public availability of 
agency inventories of activities that are 
not inherently governmental upon 
completion of OMB's review and 
consultation process concerning the 
content of the agencies' inventory 
submissions. After review and 
consultation with OMB, agencies make 
their inventories available to the public, 
and these inventories also include 
activities that are inherently 
governmental. This is the first release of 
the 2004 FAIR Act inventories. 
Interested parties who disagree with the 
agency's initial judgment can challenge

ELEMENTS OF AN AGING MANAGEMEI\IT
 
PROGRAM FOR LICENSE RENEWAL
 
Scope of program 
Scope of progrem should include the specific structures and components subject to 
an AMR for license renewal. 
2 
Preventive actions 
Preventive actions should prevent 
or mtigate aging degradation. 
3 
Parameters monitored 
or inspected 
Parameters monitored or inspected should 
be linked to the. degradation of the 
particular structure or component intended function(s). 
4 
Detection of aging 
effects 
Detection of aging effects should occur before there Is a loss of structure or 
component intended function(s). 
This includes aspects such as method or 
technique (i.e., visual, volumetric, surface inspection), frequency, sample size, data 
collection 
and timing of new/one-time inspections to ensure timely detection of 
aging effects. 
5 
Monitoring and trending 
Monitoring 
and trending should provide predictability 01 the extent of degradation, 
and timely corrective or mtigative actions. 
6 
Acceptance criteria 
Acceplance criteria, agalnst 
Which the need for conectlve action will be eval uated. 
should ensure that the structure or component intended function(s) 
are maintained
