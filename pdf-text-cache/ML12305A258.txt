SAFETY 
GUIDE 20-VIBRATION 
MEASUREMENTS 
ON REACTOR 
INTERNALS
A. 
Introduction
General 
Design. 
Criterion 
1 requires 
that
structures, 
systems 
and components 
important
to 
safety, be 
designed, 
fabricated, 
erected, 
and
tested 
to quality 
standards 
commensurate 
with
the importance 
of the safety 
functions 
to 
be
performed. 
This guide 
presents 
an acceptable
method 
for 
implementing 
this 
criterion 
with
regard to 
preoperational 
vibration 
testing 
of
reactor 
internals 
(structural 
components 
inside
the 
reactor 
vessel) important 
to safety 
to
demonstrate 
that 
flow-induced 
vibrations 
similar
in 
nature 
to those expected 
during operation
will not 
cause damage. 
Subsequent 
inservice
inspections 
to verify 
that these 
components 
have
not 
been subjected 
to 
structuraldegradation 
as a
result 
of vibration 
during normal 
reactor
operation 
are not 
covered by 
this guide.
B. 
Discussion
Reactor 
internals that 
are important 
to 
safety
are 
designed 
to withstand 
the 
predicted 
cyclic
loads 
due to 
vibration 
in combination 
with 
the
other 
loads encountered 
during 
their 
service life.
The dynamic 
conditions 
generated 
by 
the flow
of the reactor 
coolant 
within 
the reactor 
vessel
and 
reactor 
coolant 
system 
components 
are
predicted 
analytically 
and in conjunction 
with
data 
derived from 
laboratory 
and 
full-scale test
programs.
The 
purpose 
of these 
calculations 
and tests 
is
to estimate 
the 
input forcing 
functions 
which
cause vibrations 
and to verify 
the 
vibrational
response 
(frequency 
and amplitude) 
of the
reactor 
internal 
components 
predicted 
for the
prototype 
design. 
However, 
the analytical
techniques 
and limited 
test data 
available, 
at
present, 
are 
not yet 
adequate 
to. predict 
and
confirm 
the significant 
sources and 
levels of 
the
input forcing 
functions 
and 
the associated
responses 
of the 
internal 
components 
without
verification 
by measurement.
At several 
nuclear 
power 
plants, the 
dynamic
forces 
associated 
with the 
flow 
of reactor
coolant have 
resulted 
in excessive 
vibration 
of
some 
components 
of 
the reactor 
internals. 
The
• vibration 
has been 
sufficient 
to weaken 
(fatigue)
the components 
and, in some 
cases, 
has resulted
in their failure.
The 
analytical and empirical techniques
which provide 
the initial basis for 
the evaluation
of 
the effects 
of vibration 
need 
verification 
by
measurement. 
Because 
of the lack 
of experience
with vibration 
characteristics 
of various 
reactor
configurations, 
and 
the limitations 
of the
analytical 
and 
empirical 
techniques 
used to 
date,
a program 
of vibration 
analysis, 
measurement,
and 
inspection, 
is needed 
for each 
prototype
design.' 
The extent 
of 
this program 
is
dependent 
on 
the adequacy 
of 
analytical 
and
empirical 
data 
available 
for a given 
design, 
as
may be. 
derived 
from scale 
tests 
or other
prototype 
tests.
For reactors 
whose internals 
are similar in
design 
of 
that of the 
vibration-tested 
reactor
considered as 
the prototype, either an inspection
of the reactor 
internals 
following 
preoperational
functional testing, or the use of appropriate
vibration-measuring 
instrumentation to detect
the predominant 
vibratory responses 
observed in
the 
prototype 
reactor, provides 
a basis 
for
confirmation 
that 
the vibrational 
characteristics
and 
their effects 
are not unlike 
that of the
prototype 
reactor.
C. Regulatory 
Position for 
Prototype 
Reactor
Internals'
1. A 
vibration 
analysis 
and test 
program
should 
be 
developed. 
The test 
program
should 
be submitted 
for review 
by the
Commission 
prior 
to the 
performance 
of
the scheduled 
preoperational 
functional
tests.
The 
vibration 
testing 
should 
be
conducted 
with 
the fuel elements 
in 
the
core structure 
of the 
reactor 
internals 
(or
with 
dummy 
elements 
which 
provide
equivalent 
mass and 
flow characteristics).
A prototype 
design 
of reactor 
internals 
is the first
design 
respresentative 
of a group 
of reactors 
of
substantially 
the same 
design, 
size and configuration.
This group of 
reactors may include 
all those in which 
the
variations 
in 
the parameters 
of operation 
pressure,
temperature, 
flow conditions, 
coolant 
velocities, 
and
pressure 
losses for the range 
of operating conditions 
can
be 
demonstrated 
as negligible 
with respect 
to their
influence 
upon the 
input vibratory 
functions.
20.1

,Testing .may also be conducte4d with
the core structure 
not loaded with fuel
elements provided 
such conditions can be
demonstrated., to , result in 
vibrational
characteristic 
which, for the purposes 
of
the test, will yield conservativeresults.
The test program should include:
a. a 
brief description of the vibration 
test
program, including instrumentation
types and diagrams of their, 
location,
which will be used for 
measurement of
vibration responses and 
those
parameters 
which. define the input
forcing functions,
b. the planned duration 
of the test for
normal operating modes 
to assure that
all critical components are subjected 
to
at least 10'. cycles of vibration,
c. the additional test duration 
for other
than normal operating modes to assure
that 
the number of cycles imposed 
on
the critical 
components is sufficient to
analyze their adequacy to withstand
vibrations under these 
operating
modes,
d. the 
description of different flow
modes of 
operation and transients to
which the internals 
will be subjected
during the test,
e. the predominant response mode 
shapes
and 
the estimated range of numerical
values of the response 
of the major
components of the reactor internals 
in
terms of amplitudes 
and, where
appropriate, the 
anticipated values 
of
the paramaters which may 
influence
the input forcing function, under those
flow modes of 
reactor operation which
are shown by the 
analyses to be the
most critical,
f. the test 
acceptance criteria and 
the
permissible 
deviations from these
criteria, and 
the bases upon which
these criteria were established,
g. a description of 
the inspection
program which will be followed 
after
the 
completion of the vibration tests,
including the areas 
of reactor internals
subject to examination, 
the method of
examination, the design access
provisions in the reactor internals 
and
the specialized equipment to be
employed 
for performing such
examinations.
2. A vibration' 
test program should be
implemented during 
the preoperational
functional 
testing program to measure the
response
2 
of the reactor internals 
and,
where appropriate, the 
values of those
parameters 
which will define the input
forcing !functions 
for the more critical
modes 
of reactor operation. The data
obtained by these measurements on
reactor internals should be sufficient 
to
verify, 
that the cyclic stresses in 
the
components, 
as determined by analyses of
these data, are 
within the acceptable
design stress limits set forth 
in the design
specifications and applicable 
code
requirements 
and that the results meet 
the
acceptance 
criteria of the vibration test
program.
3. The extent of the measurements 
should
be determined, 
for each individual case,
on the basis 
of the design and
configuration of those structural 
elements
of the reactor 
internals important to
safety and their 
predicted behavior as
determined from the vibration 
analyses
used in their 
design. The type of vibration
test instrumentation 
used, the number of
measurements taken, and 
the distribution
of measuring devices within the 
reactor
should 
be adequate to detect the presence
of lateral, vertical, 
and torsional
amplitudes of vibration (e.g., 
beam,
column, 
and shell modes of vibrations,'as
applicable 
to the geometry of the
internals) and at sufficient locations 
to
determine 
the points of predominant
maximum 
vibratory oscillations.
4. After 
the reactor internals 
have been
subjected to the significant flo,-' 
modes
expected during service 
lifetme under
normal reactor 
operatior, and other
modes of reactor operation, visual 
and
nondestructive 
surface examinations 
of
reactor internals should be conducted 
to
detect 
any evidence of the effects 
of
vibrations. 
These examinations should be
conducted preferably 
following removal
of the 
internals from the reactor vessel.
Where removal is not 
feasible, the
examinations should 
be performed by
means of examination 
equipment
appropriate 
for in situ examination. The
areas examined should 
include all major
2 
Frequency'and 
amplitudes 
of 
vibration, 
in 
terms 
of
velocities, accelerations and displacements 
or strains.

of
the internals, and those

analyses.
5.
In 
the event either the 
inspections of
reactor 
internals reveal unacceptable
defects 
or the results of the 
vibration test
program 
fail to meet the 
specified
acceptance 
criteria, a report should 
be
prepared 
and submitted 
to the
Commission 
for review, which 
includes an
evaluation and a 
description of the
corrective, 
actions planned 
in order to
justify the adequacy 
of the reactor
internals 
design to withstand the
vibrations expected 
in service.
6. If the test and examination program is
acceptable, 
a summary 
of the results
obtained 
from the vibration 
tests and
inspection 
should be submitted 
to the
Commission after 
completion of the tests.
The summary 
should include:
a. a description 
of any differences 
from
the specified vibration 
tests program,
instrumentation reading 
anomalies and
instrument failures.
b. a comparision 
between the 
measured
values 
of vibration responses 
including
the 
parameters
3  
from 
which input
forcing 
functions are determined 
and
the predi*cted 
values from the analysis.
This comparison 
should be made for
those components 
of the reactor
internals for 
which the acceptance
criteria 
under C.l.f. have 
been
established with 
respect to the
different 
modes of 
vibration,
c. an 
evaluation of measurements 
that
exceeded acceptable 
limits or of
observations 
that were unanticipated,
and the disposition of such deviations.
'Where 
mleasurements to determine 
forcing
functions cannot 
be obtained practically 
in all areas by
means 
of pressure transducers (or 
other instruments).
such values may be estimated 
from measured responses
and from 
analytical and empirical 
results.
D. Regulatory Position 
for Reactor Internals
Similar 
to the 
Prototype 
Design
-1. The reactor internals 
important to safety
should be 
subjected during 
the
preoperational functional 
testing program
to all significant flow 
modes of normal
reactor 
operation and under 
the same test
conditions 
imposed on the 
prototype
design whose 
vibration analysis and 
tests
have been accepted 
and approved.
The test 
duration should be 
at least as
long as that 
conducted on the prototype
design.
2. Following 
completion of 
the
preoperational 
functional 
tests, the
reactor 
internals should be removed 
from
the reactor 
vessel and visual 
and
nondestructive 
examination 
of the reactor
internals 
should be conducted. 
The areas
examined should 
include:
a. 
all major load bearing 
elements of the
reactor internals relied 
upon to retain
the core structure 
in place,
b. 
the lateral, vertical, 
and torsional
restraints provided within 
the vessel,
c. those locking and 
bolting devices
whose 
failure could adversely 
affect
the structural 
integrity of the 
internals,
d. those other 
locations on the reactor
internal 
components which 
were
examined on the 
prototype design,
e. the interior 
of the reactor 
vessel for
evidence 
of 
loose 
parts 
or foreign
material.
3. In 
lieu of 
the visual 
and surface
examinations of the removed reactor
internals 
of 2. above, a vibration 
test
program may 
be implemented 
during the
preoperational 
functional 
testing 
program
by 
using sufficient 
and appropriate
vibration-measuring 
instrumentation 
to
detect 
the 
predominant 
vibratory
responses 
observed in the 
approved and
accepted prototype design.
The predominant vibratory responses
to 
be measured 
should 
be those 
which,
from the results of the prototype 
test,
identify the principal characteristics and
modes 
of vibration 
of the 
reactor 
internal
20.3

components, 
and 
which 
will permit
comparison 
of measured 
responses 
to
confirm the substantially similar
vibrational 
behavior, 
between 
the 
tested
internals 
and 
its prototype 
unit, within
the limits of the test acceptance criteria of
the prototype 
design.
In the event 
significant dissimilarity 
of
responses 
are obsered 
for specific
components, 
visual examinations 
should
be 
performed of 
these components 
by
means 
of appropriate 
examination
equipment 
which 
permits 
insitu
inspection. 
In all cases, 
the interior of the
reactor 
vessel should 
be 
visually 
checked
for evidence 
of loose parts 
and foreign
material.
4. A summary 
of the inspection 
of D.Z.
above, 
or the 
results from 
the 
vibration
test program 
of D.3. 
above, should be
submitted to 
the Commission- 
after
completion 
of 
the inspection 
and 
tests, in
the form 
of summary discussed 
under C.5.
above, to confirm 
that the 
observed
vibrational 
characteristics 
are similar 
to
those of the prototype 
design. The 
report
should 
include 
an 
evaluation 
of 
any
observed 
dissimilarity 
of responses
between 
the tested 
internals and its
prototype 
and the corrective 
actions
taken 
to confirm 
the acceptance of 
the
test 
results.
