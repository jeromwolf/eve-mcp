ACRS SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION 
Dr. Mario Bonaca, Chairman of the Plant License Renewal Subcommittee, convened the 
meeting and stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the staff's SER, with open 
items, related to the license renewal Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, and the associated 
Westinghouse topical reports. Dr. Bonaca noted that during the presentation, he would raise 
issues provided by Mr. John Barton, an ACRS consultant. He called upon Ms. Elizabeth 
Thompson, FPL, to begin. 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 2 
September 
25, 2001 
FPL PRESENTATION Ms. Elizabeth Thompson and Mr. Stephen Hale, FPL 
Ms. Thompson, presented background information concerning the preparation of the license 
renewal application for Turkey Point Units 3 and 
4. Mr. Stephen Hale, FPL, presented the 
purpose and criteria of the scoping and screening processes. He explained the scoping 
process for safety-related structures and components and for non-safety related structures and 
components that could affect safety-related equipment. Mr. Hale described the screening 
process for mechanical systems, structures, and electrical and instrumentation and control 
systems. 
Mr. Hale presented the purpose of the aging management reviews. He explained how the 
aging effects, which require aging management programs, were established based on technical 
resources, operating experience reviews, and peer reviews. He summarized the requirements 
for common aging management programs. Mr. Hale described the time limited aging analyses 
(TLAA) process and listed the seven TLAAs for Turkey Point. He concluded that: 
• The aging management programs at Turkey Point will adequately manage aging effects 
so that the intended functions of in-scope systems, structures, and components (SSCs) 
will be maintained consistent with the current licensing basis for the period of extended 
operations. 
• All TLAAs for Turkey Point were identified, evaluated, and shown to be acceptable for 
the extended period of operation. 
Dr. Shack asked why the staff had to issue a  request for additional information concerning the 
fatigue of the pressurizer surge line given that the same issue had been adequately addressed 
during the staff review of the license renewal application for Arkansas nuclear One, Unit 
1. Mr. 
Hale explained that Turkey Point is  the first plant to apply for license renewal that was 
constructed 
in accordance with B-31.1 design criteria and, as such, new questions were 
identified regarding the design of the pressurizer. In addition, the safety evaluation of the 
Westinghouse topical report WCAP-14574-A, "License Renewal Evaluation: Aging 
Management Evaluation for Pressurizes," identified new areas of concerns that the applicant 
addressed. 
Dr. Bonaca questioned how the application would have been modified if the generic guidance 
documents had been available. Mr. Hale explained that referencing the Generic Aging Lessons 
Learned (GALL) report would have been beneficial. 
Mr. Rosen asked why it was necessary to consider non-safety SSCs 
in the scoping and 
screening process. Mr. Hale stated that since Turkey Point was one of the early plants which 
was licensed, not all systems now considered to be safety-related were identified as safety­
related. 
In response to a question prepared by Mr. Barton, Mr. Hale explained why the following SSCs 
were not included 
in scope: 
•  Hot containment penetrations lines are outside plant structures and will not exceed 
150°F if a  line break occurs. 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 3 
September 
25, 2001 
•  The consequences of a release from the ventilation system of the Radiological Waste 
Building is  less than 10 CFR Part 100 limits. 
•  The screen wash system is not necessary to maintain suction during a severe accident, 
since the circulating water pumps are secured. 
•  The C-bus only provides power to non-safety loads. 
•  The off-site transformers are not necessary during severe accidents since the safety­
related diesel generators provide power. 
Mr. Bonaca questioned why the spent fuel pool cooling system was within scope for Turkey 
Point when all previous applicants considered spent fuel pool cooling systems to be outside the 
scope of license renewal. Mr. Stephen Hoffman explained that scoping of SSCs was 
dependent of the current design basis for each plant. 
The Subcommittee members and FPL representatives discussed the aging management 
program for the fatigue of thin wall stainless steel piping located 
in trenches outside the turbine 
building. Mr. Hale explained that the aging management program for these pipes was derived 
from operational experience of similar pipes at St. Lucie. 
Dr. Ford questioned how licensees predict the failure of component, such as baffle bolts, and 
how they calculated the risk associated with these failures. Mr. Hale explained that the industry 
uses operating experience and the results of inservice inspections and inservice tests to move 
toward risk-informed inspection programs. He noted that aging management programs rely 
on 
defense-in-depth designs, operating experience, redundancy, and early defect detection to 
control risk. 
Dr. Bonaca asked why ASME Class 
II pipes were not within the scope of license renewal when 
they were physically located over Class I pipes. Mr. Hale explained that failures of ASME Class 
II pipes were not part of the current design accident analyses and that non-safety related 
systems which affect safety related components are already considered within scope 
(Le. piping 
supports). 
NRC SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT (SER) PRESENTATION 
Introduction: 
Mr. Rajender Auluck, NRR 
Mr. Rajender Auluck outlined the staff's presentation and introduced the presenters. He 
provided an overview of the license review schedule and the SER format. Mr. Auluck 
summarized the open items and the staff's inspection activities. During discussions with the 
Subcommittee members, Mr. Auluck provided the following information. 
•  
In response to the emerging issue of reactor vessel head penetration cracking, the 
applicant committed to adopt future industry recommendations. 
•  Emerging issues, which are identified after the operating license is  renewed, will be 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 4 
September 25,2001 
handled by using the existing site-specific corrective action program. 
•  Babcock and Wilcox manufactured the Turkey Point reactor vessel to Westinghouse 
specifications. 
•  The Turkey Point fatigue monitoring program verifies commutative usage factors are not 
exceeded. 
•  The Turkey Point license renewal application contained most of the required 
information, however, the staff needed assistance 
in located specific information. 
Chap. 2.0 -Structures and Components Subject to an Aging Management Review: 
Messrs. Greg Galletti and Brian Thomas, NRR 
The staff described its methodology for reviewing the applicant's scoping and screening 
process, its on-site audits, and its findings and conclusions. 
Mr. Rosen questioned the use of the emergency operating procedures (EOPs) 
in the scoping 
and screening processes. Mr. Galletti explained that the results of the processes were 
compared to the maintenance program results, which were derived 
in part, by using the EOPs. 
Mr. Rosen noted that the staff did not evaluate the qualification and training of licensee 
personnel on the commitments made 
in the license renewal application. Ms. Thompson, FPL, 
stated that the new information 
in the application was automatically included in the training 
programs for licensee engineers. 
Chap. 3.1 - Common Aging Management Programs: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR 
Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR, identified the common aging management programs the staff 
reviewed. 
Chap. 3.2 -Reactor Coolant System: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR 
Ms. Khanna identified the systems reviewed by the staff. She noted that the applicant did not 
reference the Westinghouse topical reports 
in the application, but did compare the topical report 
results to the commitments 
in the application. She stated that the reactor vessel head 
penetration nozzle cracking will be managed by the reactor vessel head alloy 
600 penetration 
inspection program. 
Dr. Bonaca questioned whether all Westinghouse topical report action items were addressed 
in 
the application. Mr. Hale, FPL, explained that the action items not addressed in the application 
were addressed 
in subsequent responses to staff Requests for Additional Information. 
Dr. Ford asked if the reactor vessel internals aging management program had been reviewed 
against the ASME code. Mr. Allen Hiser, Jr., NRR, explained that the inspection programs were 
still being developed and that the staff was monitoring the industry's progress. 
Dr. Ford asked when data would become available to better predict component failures. The 
staff explained that inspections were ongoing at established intervals and that if  research 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 5 
September 
25, 2001 
results indicated problems, then the inspection intervals would be shortened. Dr. Ford stated 
that not enough data presently exists and that 10 year is  too long to wait. He suggested that 
calculated changes 
in the loss of coolant accident frequency should be used to determine the 
priority of research needs. 
In response to questions from Dr. Bonaca the staff and Mr. Hale explained that: 
•  the containment radiation monitors were within the scope of license renewal, however, 
no aging effects had been identified and no aging management programs were 
necessary; and 
•  the main steam insolation valve air accumulators are within scope and have an aging 
management program, however, the backup instrument air bottles, which are routinely 
replaced, are not within scope and do not have an aging management program. 
Chap. 3.3 -Engineered Safety Features: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR 
Ms. Khanna identified the systems reviewed by the staff. She noted that the applicant 
adequately identified the aging effects and applicable aging management programs for each 
component of the engineered safety features system. 
Chap. 3.4 -Auxiliary Systems: Mr. James Davis, NRR 
Mr. James Davis, NRR, identified the systems reviewed by the staff. The Subcommittee 
members and the staff discussed inspections requirements for inaccessible areas and 
operating experience at other plants. The staff agreed to provide the Subcommittee an 
explanation for why the intake structure does not have an aging management program. 
Chap. 3.5 -Steam and Power Conversion Systems: Mr. James Davis, NRR 
Mr. Davis identified the systems reviewed by the staff. 
Chap. 3.6 -Structures and Components: Mr. Clifford Munson, NRR 
Mr. Clifford Munson, NRR, identified the structural components and commodities reviewed by 
the staff. 
Chap. 3.7 -Electrical Components: Mr. Paul Shemanski, NRR 
Mr. Paul Shemanski, NRR, identified the electrical component types subject to aging 
management review. He noted that no aging management program was required for non­
environmentally qualified (EO) medium voltage cables subject to moisture, since the cables 
were designed with a lead sheath to prevent failure from water treeing due to moisture ingress. 
He stated that on the basis of the staff's review, the applicant developed a new aging 
management program for non-EO cables, connections, and electrical penetrations. The 
Subcommittee and Mr. Shemanski discussed the operating experience and testing of the lead 
sheath cables. 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 6 
September 25,2001 
Chap. 3.8 -New Aging Management Programs: Ms. Andrea Keim, NRR 
Ms. Andrea Keim, NRR, identi'fied the aging management programs that were developed to 
support the license renewal application. Dr. Shack questioned the meaningfulness of the one­
time inspection of small bore piping. 
Mr. Barry Elliot, NRR, explained that cracking in small 
bore piping has not been a problem and that the one-time inspection is  intended to confirm the 
absence of cracking. 
Dr. Shack stated that the applicant's proposal to use a 
VT-1 visual inspection of baffle bolts was 
insufficient, 
in and of itself, but would be acceptable if performed in conjunction with an 
ultrasonic test. He stated that one-time inspections of reactor vessel internals using a 
VT-1 
visual inspection as implied by the SER, is  not sufficient. The staff agreed to review and modify 
the SER to clarify this issue. 
Field erected 
tanks internal inspection: Mr. Clifford Munson, NRR, explained the 
open item concerning one-time inspection of condensate storage tanks, demineralized 
water storage tanks, and the refueling water storage tank. 
Galvanic corrosion susceptibility inspection program: Mr. James Davis, NRR, 
identified the specific component and commodity groups for which credit was taken for 
this aging management program. 
He described the use of baseline examinations and 
one-time inspections. 
Chap. 3.9 -
Existing Aging Management Review: Ms. Andrea Keim, NRR 
Ms. Keim identified the existing aging management programs reviewed by the staff. Dr. Ford 
stated that the staff should take a leadership role 
in resolving emerging aging degradation 
issues. Mr. Elliot explained that licensees are responsible for identifying emergent issues and 
determining appropriate resolution, where as the staff is responsible for confirming the 
adequacy of the proposed resolutions. 
Chap. 4.0 - Time-Limited 
Aging Analyses: Messrs. Barry Elliot and Paul Shemanski, NRR 
Mr. Barry Elliot, NRR, identified the time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs) reviewed by the staff. 
Reactor vessel 
irradiation embrittlement: Mr. Elliot noted that the applicant must 
apply the chemistry factor ratio adjustment to the surveillance data when submitting the 
48 EFPY pressure-temperature curves for staff approval. He observed that the 
circumferential weld between the nozzle belt and the intermediate shell approaches 
RT
PTS screening criterion at end of life and should be tracked and considered by the 
licensee 
in future submittals. 
The Subcommittee and the staff discussed the appropriateness of allowing licensees to 
continue operating reactor pressure vessels that are within a few degrees of the 
pressurized thermal shock screening criterion. The staff explained that the screening 
criterion is very conservative and that if the criterion is exceeded licensees are required 
to perform plant-specific evaluations. 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 7 
September 
25, 2001 
Metal fatigue: Mr. Elliot identified an open item that requires the staff to complete a 
review of the Westinghouse topical report regarding the evaluation of underclad 
cracking. 
Environmental review process: Mr. Shemanski noted the staff disagreed with the 
applicant as to which requirement 
in 10 CFR 54.21, "Contents of application - Technical 
information," is being met, but accepts the application on the basis of the technical 
adequacy of the equipment qualification. The applicant committed to revise the EO 
documentation package to referenced the wear cycle aging effect on Westinghouse and 
Joy motors. 
WESTINGHOUSE TOPICAL REPORTS Mr. Barry Elliot, NRR 
Mr. Elliot presented the materials used, the aging effects, aging management programs, 
TLAAs, renewal application action items, and significant technical issues for the following 
Westinghouse Topical Reports: 
•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14422 Rev. 2-A, "Licensing Renewal 
Evaluation: Aging Managementfor Reactor Coolant Systems Supports." 
•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14574-A, "License Renewal Evaluation: Aging 
Management Evaluation for Pressurizers." 
•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14575-A, "Aging Management Evaluation for 
Class 1 Piping and Associated Pressure Boundary Components." 
•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14577 Rev. 1-A, "License Renewal Evaluation: 
Aging Management for Reactor Internals." 
Mr. Elliot concluded that upon completion of all renewal application action items, applicants who 
reference the topical reports will have adequately demonstrated that the aging of components 
within the scope of the topical reports can be managed adequately for the period of extended 
operations. 
Dr. Ford stated that the reports do not provide data concerning the effects on safety margins 
and questioned how a reviewer would be able to make a decision on the adequacy of the aging 
management programs. The Subcommittee recognized that this information relates to the 
current licensing basis and not to the license renewal process. 
Dr. Bonaca stated that 
in order to make a clear distinction between the current licensing basis 
and license renewal commitments, the SERs should include a description of the philosophy and 
implementation of the license renewal process. 
SUBCOMMITTEE COMMENTS, CONCERNS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
Mr. Rosen requested additional information concerning allowing continued plant operations 
when the calculated reference temperature of the reactor pressure vessel (RT
PTS) is within a 
few degrees of the pressurized thermal shock screening criterion. 

Minutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 8 
September 25, 
2001 
Mr. Rosen stated that in order to retain corporate knowledge, licensees should be required to 
provide training on license renewal commitments to their employees. 
Mr. Rosen stated that there should be clarity as to how EOPs should be used 
in the license 
renewal screening process. 
Dr. Ford stated the license renewal application identified aging management programs. 
However, Dr. Ford expressed his view that the topical reports did not contain sufficient data for 
reviewers to reach well supported decisions. The topical reports rely 
on programs that are part 
of the current licensing basis. 
Drs. Shack and Bonaca stated that the table format used 
in the application was good and easy 
to follow. Dr. Shack noted that the application on the CD Rom was easy to use, however, the 
hard copy of the application was difficult to navigate. 
Dr. Bonaca agreed with the staff's position concerning the evaluation of seismic ASME Class 
II 
pipes located over Class I components 
The Subcommittee agreed that the Westinghouse topical reports would be useful for future 
applicants. 
STAFF AND INDUSTRY COMMITMENTS 
The staff committed to provide the ACRS with a  reference for an explanation of the applicants 
scoping methodology. [Provided 9/25/01; Application for Renewed Operating License for 
Turkey Point Units 3 & 
4, pages 2.1-4 to 2.1-12] 
The staff agreed to consider clarifying its approval for use of the VT
-1 inspection for reactor 
vessel internals including baffle bolts. 
The staff committed to provide the ACRS a copy of the Request for Additional Information 
regarding the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel. [Provided 9/25/0"\] 
SUBCOMMITTEE DECISIONS 
The Subcommittee decided not to prepare an interim letter nor a letter concerning the 
Westinghouse Topical Reports. 
The Subcommittee requested that the staff present an abbreviate version of its presentation 
regarding the SER and Westinghouse Topical Reports to the ACRS on October 
5,2001. 
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS 
The Subcommittee plans to visit Turkey Point Units 3 and 4, after the resolution of the 
remaining open items are documented 
in the SER.

Items 
of Interest: 
The electrical equipment identified in Section 
4.4.1 of the LRA, the 
applicant uses 10 CFR 
54.21 (c)(1)(i) in its TLAA evaluation to demonstrate 
that the analyses remain valid for the period of extended operation. The 
staff disagrees and finds the applicant's demonstration to be consistent 
with 10 CFR 54.21 (c)(1)(ii). However, the staff accepted the applicant's 
classification 
of these TLAAs under 10 CFR 54.21 (c)(1 )(i) since it does not 
affect the technical adequacy of the equipment qualification. 
The applicant did 
not address the wear cycle aging effect on motors 
(Westinghouse and Joy) adequately. The applicant committed 
to revise the 
EQ documentation package for these motors to address the staff's 
concern.
