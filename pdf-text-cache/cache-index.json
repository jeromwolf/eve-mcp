Diaz\nChairman\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, DC 20555-0001\nSUBJECT:REPORT ON THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE LICENSE RENEWAL\nAPPLICATION FOR THE H. B. ROBINSON STEAM ELECTRIC PLANT, UNIT 2\nDear Chairman Diaz:\nDuring the 510th meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, March 3-6, 2004,\nwe completed our review of the License Renewal Application (LRA) for the H. B. Robinson\nSteam Electric Plant, Unit 2, known as Robinson Nuclear Plant, and the related final Safety\nEvaluation Report (SER) prepared by the NRC staff.  Our Plant License Renewal\nSubcommittee reviewed this application and the staff’s initial SER during a meeting on\nSeptember 30, 2003.  During these reviews, we had the benefit of discussions with\nrepresentatives of the NRC staff and the Carolina Power and Light Company (CP&L).  We also\nhad the benefit of the documents referenced.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.The programs instituted and committed to by CP&L to manage age-related degradation\nare appropriate and provide reasonable assurance that the Robinson Nuclear Plant can\nbe operated in accordance with its current licensing basis for the period of extended\noperation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.\n2.The CP&L application for renewal of the operating license for Robinson Nuclear Plant\nshould be approved.\nBACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION\nThis report fulfills the requirements of 10 CFR 54.25, which states that the ACRS should review\nand report on all license renewal applications.  In its application, CP&L requested renewal of the\noperating license for the Robinson Nuclear Plant for 20 years beyond the current license term,\nwhich expires on July 31, 2010.  Robinson Nuclear Plant is a Westinghouse-designed, three-\nloop, pressurized-water reactor rated at 2,339 megawatts-thermal (MWt) with replacement\nsteam generators installed in 1984.  It is located adjacent to Unit 1 of the H.B. Robinson Steam\nElectric Plant, a coal fired steam power plant.  The LRA was prepared in accordance with\nNUREG 1801, The Generic Aging Lessons Learned Report. \n\n-2-\nThe Robinson Nuclear Plant final SER documents the results of the staff’s review of the\ninformation submitted by the applicant, including commitments that were necessary to resolve\nopen and confirmatory items identified by the staff in the initial SER and those identified during\nonsite NRC inspections and audits.  In particular, the staff reviewed the completeness of the\napplicant’s identification of structures, systems, and components that are within the scope of\nlicense renewal, the integrated plant assessment process, the identification of the plausible\naging mechanisms associated with passive long-lived components, the adequacy of the aging\nmanagement programs, and the identification and assessment of time limited aging analyses\n(TLAAs) requiring review.\nSeveral design features that are unique to Robinson Nuclear Plant, such as grouted tendons,\ncontainment liner insulation, and some shared systems with a fossil unit, were identified.  All\nshared systems are included in the scope of the LRA.\nRobinson Nuclear Plant site has aggressive ground water due to a low pH.  The applicant has\ncommitted to inspect the dam spillway and the intake structures every 10-years and will also\nperform opportunistic inspections of inaccessible concrete structures.\nThe pressurizer spray head is not in scope and, given its importance for cooldown, we\nquestioned its omission.  The applicant responded that the accident-basis analysis for plant\noperation does not include pressurizer spray so its exclusion is permissible.  The applicant\nfurther stated that degradation of the nozzle would be noticed during normal operation.\nThe applicant stated that the plant has 37 existing aging management programs, of which 27\nhave been enhanced, and 10 new programs have been added.  Several of these programs\nhave yet to be developed and they will require NRC approval.  As with other applicants, we\nencouraged CP&L to establish a schedule for implementing these commitments well ahead of\nthe beginning of the license renewal period so as not to place an unreasonable demand on both\nthe applicant and NRC resources.  CP&L has committed to have 18 of these programs in place\nby mid 2004.  \nTime limited aging analyses were performed by the applicant to evaluate reactor vessel neutron\nembrittlement, metal fatigue for certain components, environmental qualification, grouted\nconcrete containment tendon prestress, boraflex aging, and foundation pile corrosion.  All these\nissues have been resolved satisfactorily.  In the case of reactor vessel neutron embrittlement,\nthe staff performed independent calculations and found the applicant’s analysis acceptable.\nWe agree with the staff’s conclusion that all open and confirmatory items have been closed\nappropriately.  We conclude that on the basis of our review of the final SER, the LRA, and the\nNRC inspection and audit reports, there are no issues, specifically related to the matters\ndescribed in 10 CFR 54.29(a)(1) and (a)(2), that preclude renewal of the operating license for\nthe plant.  The programs instituted and committed to by CP&L to manage age-related \n\n-3-\ndegradation are appropriate and provide reasonable assurance that the  plant can be operated\nin accordance with its current licensing basis for the period of extended operation without undue\nrisk to the health and safety of the public.  The CP&L application for renewal of the operating\nlicense for the Robinson Nuclear Plant should be approved.\nSincerely,\n/RA/\nMario V.

Diaz\nChairman\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, DC 2005-0001\nSUBJECT:REPORT ON THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE LICENSE RENEWAL\nAPPLICATION FOR ARKANSAS NUCLEAR ONE, UNIT 2\nDear Chairman Diaz:\nDuring the 522\nnd\n meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, May 5-6, 2005,\nwe completed our review of the license renewal application for Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 2\n(ANO-2), and the associated final Safety Evaluation Report (SER) prepared by the NRC staff. \nOur Plant License Renewal Subcommittee also reviewed this matter during a meeting on\nDecember 1, 2004.  During our review, we had the benefit of discussions with representatives\nof the NRC staff and Entergy Operations, Inc. (Entergy).  We also had the benefit of the\ndocuments referenced. This report fulfills the requirements of 10 CFR 54.25 that the ACRS\nreview and report on all license renewal applications.\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\n1.The programs established and committed to by the applicant to manage age-related\ndegradation provide reasonable  assurance that ANO-2 can be operated in accordance\nwith its current licensing basis for the period of extended operation without undue risk to\nthe health and safety of the public.\n2.The Entergy application for renewal of the operating license for ANO-2 should be\napproved.\nBACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION\nANO-2 is a Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor rated at 3026 MWt, enclosed in\na large dry containment building.  The current power rating includes a 7.5% power uprate \nimplemented in 2002.  The ANO-2 steam generators were replaced with new Westinghouse\nDelta steam generators with Alloy 690 tubing in conjunction with this power uprate.  \nEntergy requested renewal of the ANO-2 operating license for 20 years beyond the current\nlicense term, which expires on July 17, 2018.  In the final SER, the staff documents its review of\nthe license renewal application and other information submitted by Entergy and obtained during\nthe audits and inspections at the plant site. The staff reviewed the completeness of the\napplicant’s identification of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that are within the\nscope of license renewal; the integrated plant assessment process; the applicant’s identification\nof plausible aging mechanisms associated with passive, long-lived components; the adequacy\nof the applicant’s aging management programs; and the identification and assessment of time-\nlimited aging analyses (TLAAs).  \n\n-2-\nThe ANO-2 application demonstrates consistency with the Generic Aging Lessons Learned\n(GALL) Report or documents deviations from the approaches specified in that report.  The\nANO-2 application is the second one evaluated by the staff using the new audit and review\nprocess developed to confirm consistency with, and the acceptability of deviations from, the\nGALL Report.  The new process requires that more review activities be conducted at the site. \nAs in the first application, this approach has resulted in more effective interactions between the\napplicant and the staff and has significantly reduced requests for additional information (RAIs). \nDuring its review, the staff identified several components that the applicant should have\nincluded in the scope of license renewal but did not.  The applicant subsequently brought them\ninto scope.  The staff concluded that these omissions were the result of minor oversights or\ndifferent interpretations of the scoping methodology, and not an indication of process problems. \nThe staff also concluded that the applicant’s scoping and screening processes have\nsuccessfully identified SSCs within the scope of license renewal and subject to an aging\nmanagement review.  We agree with these conclusions.\nThe applicant performed a comprehensive aging management review of all SSCs within the\nscope of license renewal.  In the application, Entergy describes 34 aging management\nprograms for license renewal, including existing, enhanced, and new programs.  We agree with\nthe staff’s conclusion that these programs are adequate.\nImplementation is key to effective aging management programs.  Although the applicant’s\nStructures Monitoring-Masonry Wall Program is consistent with the GALL Report, the staff’s\naudit of this program revealed that the initial baseline examinations were not documented\nproperly, the first 5-year reexamination was not performed, and qualifications for personnel\nresponsible for walkdowns were not established.  The Annual Assessment Letter for ANO,\nUnits 1 and 2, dated March 3, 2004, had already identified a substantive cross-cutting issue\nconcerning problem identification and resolution.  Based on the Annual Assessment Letter\ndated March 2, 2005, the weaknesses in the ANO-2 Problem Identification and Resolution\nProgram appear to have been corrected.  Maintaining an effective problem identification and\nresolution program is critical to the success of the aging management programs.\nAs in previous reviews, we questioned the adequacy of relying on opportunistic inspections of\ninaccessible buried piping and tanks, in lieu of periodic inspections at a plant-specific\nfrequency, as specified in the GALL Report.  The applicant has committed to enhance its\nBuried Piping Inspection Program by performing an inspection within 10 years of entering the\nperiod of extended operation unless an opportunistic inspection has occurred within this 10-year\nperiod.  This program enhancement is appropriate.  \nThe applicant identified and reevaluated systems and components requiring TLAAs for 20 more\nyears of operation.  The applicant’s analyses of reactor vessel embrittlement (upper shelf\nenergy, pressurized thermal shock, and pressure-temperature limits), independently verified by\nthe staff, demonstrate that the limiting beltline materials will satisfy the acceptance criteria at 48\neffective full-power years (EFPYs).  This value corresponds to a constant capacity factor of\n80% for 60 years.  We questioned the use of 48 EFPYs, rather than the 54 EFPYs used by\nother applicants to bound 60 years of operation.  Given the current performance of the fleet, 54\nEFPYs seems to be a more appropriate value for 60 years of operation.  The staff\nindependently verified that the upper shelf energy and pressurized thermal shock acceptance\ncriteria would still be met at 54 EFPYs. \n\n-3-\nIn 2000, nondestructive examinations revealed a number of leaks in pressurizer and hot-leg\npenetration nozzles.  The applicant implemented repairs using the half-nozzle repair technique. \nThe applicant evaluated the potential for existing flaws in the remaining pressurizer and hot-leg\npenetration welds to propagate into the pressurizer or hot leg.  The applicant has performed a\nTLAA to bound the period of extended operation and has demonstrated that stress corrosion\ncracking will not cause existing flaws to propagate into the carbon steel or low-alloy steel base\nmetal.  \nSince a shroud prevents a complete 360E bare metal visual inspection of some of the control\nrod drive mechanism (CRDM) penetrations, the applicant performed alternative eddy current\nand volumetric inspections.  Although these inspections did not identify any cracking or\nleakage, ANO-2 is ranked as highly susceptible to CRDM cracking. The applicant has\nscheduled the procurement of a new reactor vessel head in 2006.  Meanwhile, the applicant\nplans to modify the shroud to allow increased access for visual examinations. \nWe agree with the staff that no issues related to the matters described in 10 CFR 54.29(a)(1)\nand (a)(2) preclude renewal of the operating license for ANO-2.  The programs established and\ncommitted to by Entergy provide reasonable assurance that ANO-2 can be operated in\naccordance with its current licensing basis for the period of extended operation without undue\nrisk to the health and safety of the public.  The Entergy application for renewal of the operating\nlicense for ANO-2 should be approved.\nSincerely,\n    /RA/ \nGraham B.

Klein\nChairman\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, DC 2005-0001\nSUBJECT:REPORT ON THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE LICENSE RENEWAL\nAPPLICATION FOR THE MONTICELLO NUCLEAR GENERATING\nPLANT\nDear Chairman Klein:\nDuring the 535\nth\n meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards,\nSeptember 7-8, 2006, we completed our review of the license renewal application for\nthe Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant (MNGP) and the final Safety Evaluation Report\n(SER) prepared by the NRC staff.  Our Plant License Renewal Subcommittee also\nreviewed this matter during a meeting on May 30, 2006.  During our review, we had the\nbenefit of discussions with representatives of the NRC staff and the applicant, Nuclear\nManagement Company, LLC (NMC).  We also had the benefit of the documents\nreferenced. This report fulfills the requirements of 10 CFR 54.25 that the ACRS review\nand report on all license renewal applications.\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\nThe programs established and committed to by the applicant to manage age-related\ndegradation provide reasonable assurance that MNGP can be operated in accordance\nwith its current licensing basis for the period of extended operation without undue risk to\nthe health and safety of the public.\nThe NMC application for renewal of the operating license for MNGP should be\napproved.\nBACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION\nMNGP is a General Electric Boiling Water Reactor-3 (BWR-3) within a Mark-I\ncontainment.  The current power rating of 1775 MWt includes a 6.3% power uprate that\nwas implemented in 1998.  NMC requested renewal of the MNGP operating license for\n20 years beyond the current license term, which expires on September 8, 2010.\n\n-2-\nIn the final SER, the staff documented its review of the license renewal application and\nother information submitted by NMC and obtained during the audits and inspections\nconducted at the plant site.  The staff reviewed the completeness of the applicant’s\nidentification of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that are within the scope\nof license renewal; the integrated plant assessment process; the applicant’s\nidentification of the plausible aging mechanisms associated with passive, long-lived\ncomponents; the adequacy of the applicant’s Aging Management Programs (AMPs);\nand the identification and assessment of time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs) requiring\nreview.  \nThe NMC application is largely consistent with the Generic Aging Lessons Learned\n(GALL) Report.  All deviations from the approaches specified in the GALL Report are\ndocumented in the application.  The applicant identified the SSCs that fall within the\nscope of license renewal and performed a comprehensive aging management review\nfor these SSCs.  Based on the results of this review, the applicant will implement 36\nAMPs for license renewal including existing, enhanced, and new programs.  In the\nSER, the staff concluded that the applicant has appropriately identified the SSCs within\nthe scope of license renewal and that the AMPs described by the applicant are\nappropriate and sufficient to manage aging of long-lived passive components that are\nwithin the scope of license renewal.  We concur with this conclusion.\nThe staff conducted an inspection and an audit.  The inspection verified that the\nscoping and screening methodologies are consistent with the regulations and are\nadequately reflected in the application.  The audit verified the appropriateness of the\nAMPs and the aging management reviews.  Based on the inspection and audit, the staff\nconcluded that these programs are consistent with the descriptions contained in the\nNMC license renewal application.  The staff also concluded that the existing programs,\nto be credited as AMPs for license renewal, are generally functioning well and that an\nimplementation plan has been established in the applicant’s commitment tracking\nsystem to ensure timely completion of the license renewal commitments.\nDuring our meetings with the staff and the applicant, we discussed the adequacy of\nprograms proposed by NMC to manage aging of certain components that are a current\nfocus of the staff and the industry, as described below.\nAging of the drywell shell of MNGP will be managed through the use of the ASME\nSection XI, Subsection IWE Program.  We agree with this approach.  Even though this\nProgram does not include ultrasonic testing, this approach was chosen by NMC and\naccepted by the staff because the plant has several design features that prevent water\naccumulation behind the shell.  During each refueling outage, water leakage is\nmonitored from the refueling seal bellows, the drywell air gap drains, and the sand-\npocket drains. The refueling seal is within the scope of license renewal.  Ultrasonic\ninspections performed in the past did not identify any degradation.  \n\n-3-\nMNGP has experienced shroud cracking.  This cracking was identified through the\nrequired licensee inspection process.  Periodic inspections of up to 75% of the shroud\nwelds are performed according to the guidelines of the Boiling Water Reactor Vessel\nand Internals Project (BWRVIP).  Previously identified flaws have exhibited no\nsignificant crack growth since the introduction of hydrogen water chemistry at MNGP. \nAging of the shroud will continue to be managed by using the guidelines in  the\nBWRVIP-76.  We find this AMP appropriate.\nThe MNGP steam dryers are within the scope of license renewal.  A 1998 inspection\nidentified an indication that was not structurally significant.  A 2001 inspection revealed\nno change in this indication and no additional indications were identified.  A\ncomprehensive inspection conducted in 2005 to examine areas where steam dryer\nfailures had occurred at other plants found new indications on the dryer shell.  These\nindications were evaluated and determined to be acceptable by the applicant.  Another\ninspection is planned for 2007.  Aging of the steam dryers will continue to be managed\nin accordance with the guidelines in the BWRVIP-139  program.  We find this AMP\nappropriate.\nThe applicant identified the systems and components requiring TLAAs and reevaluated\nthem for 20 more years of operation.  Affected TLAAs included those associated with\nneutron embrittlement, metal fatigue, irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking,\nenvironmental qualification of electrical equipment, and stress relaxation of hold-down\nbolts.  The staff concluded that the applicant has provided an adequate list of TLAAs.\nFurther, the staff concluded that in all cases the applicant has met the requirements of\nthe license renewal rule by demonstrating that the TLAAs will remain valid for the period\nof extended operation, or that the TLAAs have been projected to the end of the period\nof extended operation, or that the aging effects will be adequately managed for the\nperiod of extended operation.  We concur with the staff that MNGP TLAAs have been\nproperly identified and that criteria supporting 20 more years of operation have been\nmet.\nWe agree with the staff that there are no issues related to the matters described in \n10 CFR 54.29(a)(1) and (a)(2) that preclude renewal of the operating license for MNGP. \nThe programs established and committed to by NMC provide reasonable assurance\nthat MNGP can be operated in accordance with its current licensing basis for the period\nof extended operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.  The\nNMC application for renewal of the operating license for MNGP should be approved.\nSincerely,\n    /RA/\n \nGraham B.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, DC 20555-0001\nSubject:REPORT ON THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE LICENSE RENEWAL\nAPPLICATION FOR THE PALISADES NUCLEAR POWER PLANT\nDear Chairman Klein:\nDuring the 537\nth\n meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, November\n1-3, 2006, we completed our review of the license renewal application for the Palisades\nNuclear Plant (PNP) and the final Safety Evaluation Report (SER) prepared by the NRC\nstaff.  Our Plant License Renewal Subcommittee also reviewed this matter during a\nmeeting on July 11, 2006.  During our review, we had the benefit of discussions with\nrepresentatives of the NRC staff and the applicant, Nuclear Management Company,\nLLC (NMC).  In addition, we had the benefit of input from the public.  We also had the\nbenefit of the documents referenced.  This report fulfills the requirements of 10 CFR\n54.25 that the ACRS review and report on all license renewal applications.\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION\nThe programs established and committed to by the applicant to manage age-related\ndegradation provide reasonable assurance that PNP can be operated in accordance\nwith its current licensing basis for the period of extended operation without undue risk to\nthe health and safety of the public.\nThe NMC application for renewal of the operating license for PNP should be approved. \nContinued operation during the entire period of extended operation is contingent on the\nresolution of the issues associated with three Time-Limited Aging Analyses (TLAAs)\nrelated to reactor pressure vessel (RPV) integrity.\nBACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION\nPNP is a Combustion Engineering 2-loop pressurized water nuclear plant with a large,\ndry, ambient-pressure containment.  PNP is located five miles south of South Haven,\nMichigan, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan.  The current power rating of the PNP \n\n-2-\nis 2566 MWt, for a gross electrical output of 767 MWe.  PNP was originally licensed to\noperate on February 21, 1971.  NMC requested renewal of the PNP operating license\nfor 20 years beyond the current license term, which expires on February 20, 2011.\nIn the final SER, the staff documented its review of the license renewal application and\nother information submitted by NMC and obtained during the audit and inspection\nconducted at the plant site.  The staff reviewed the completeness of the applicant’s\nidentification of structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that are within the scope\nof license renewal; the integrated plant assessment process; the applicant’s\nidentification of the plausible aging mechanisms associated with passive long-lived\ncomponents; the adequacy of the applicant’s Aging Management Programs (AMPs);\nand the identification and assessment of TLAAs requiring review.\nThe NMC application is largely consistent with NUREG-1801, “Generic Aging Lessons\nLearned (GALL) Report,” issued in July 2001.  All deviations from the GALL Report are\ndocumented in the application.  The applicant identified the SSCs that fall within the\nscope of license renewal and performed a comprehensive aging management review\nfor these SSCs.  Based on the results of this review, the applicant will implement 24\nAMPs for license renewal including existing, enhanced, and new programs.  In the final\nSER, the staff concluded that the applicant has appropriately identified the SSCs within\nthe scope of license renewal and that the AMPs described by the applicant are\nappropriate and sufficient to manage aging of long-lived passive components that are\nwithin the scope of license renewal.  We concur with this conclusion.\nThe staff conducted an inspection and an audit.  The inspection verified that the\nscoping and screening methodologies are consistent with the regulations and are\nadequately reflected in the application.  The audit verified the appropriateness of the\nAMPs and the aging management reviews.  Based on the inspection and audit, the staff\nconcluded that these programs are consistent with the descriptions contained in the\nNMC license renewal application.  The staff also concluded that the existing programs,\nto be credited as AMPs for license renewal, are generally functioning well and that an\nimplementation plan has been established in the applicant’s commitment tracking\nsystem to ensure timely completion of the license renewal commitments.\nDuring our meetings with the staff and the applicant, we discussed the adequacy of\nprograms proposed by NMC to manage aging of certain components that are projected\nto exceed acceptance limits during the period of extended operation.\nThe applicant identified the systems and components requiring TLAAs and reevaluated\nthem for 20 additional years of operation.  As required by 10 CFR Part 54, the applicant\nmust identify any exemptions granted under 10 CFR 50.12 which rely on a TLAA and \n\n-3-\ndetermine if that exemption should be continued for an additional 20 years of operation. \nNo such exemption currently exists in the PNP licensing basis.  The applicant\nreexamined 23 TLAAs.  All of these TLAAs are valid, without restriction, for 20 more\nyears of operation, except for three TLAAs associated with reactor vessel neutron\nembrittlement, namely:  reactor vessel upper shelf energy, reactor vessel pressurized\nthermal shock, and reactor vessel pressure-temperature curves.  In each of these\ncases, PNP will exceed the acceptance limits prior to the end of the extended period of\noperation.  \nTo analyze the reactor vessel neutron fluence for purposes of RPV integrity\nevaluations, the applicant uses the methodology described in WCAP-15353, which is\nconsistent with Regulatory Guide 1.190.  \nThe applicant began using low neutron leakage cores in 1988 to reduce the neutron\nembrittlement of the reactor vessel to extend the time before exceeding the acceptance\nlimits.  However, the applicant predicts that the following acceptance limits will be\nexceeded:\n•Upper Shelf Energy limit – exceed in 2021.\n•Reactor Vessel Pressurized Thermal Shock (PTS) screening criterion – exceed\nin 2014.\n•Pressure-Temperature limit curves – expire in 2014.\nThe staff’s confirmatory calculations show reasonable agreement with the applicant’s\nfindings.  \nUpper Shelf Energy Limit\n.  The applicant predicts this criterion will be exceeded in\n2021.  Appendix G of 10 CFR 50 requires RPV beltline materials to have Charpy upper\nshelf energy values no less than 50 ft-lb in the transverse direction in the base metal\nand along a weld for weld material.  However, in accordance with Appendix G, Charpy\nupper shelf energy values below 50 ft-lb  may be acceptable if it is demonstrated that\nlower Charpy upper shelf energy values will provide margins of safety against fracture\n(ductile tearing) equivalent to those required by ASME Code, Section XI, Appendix G. \nRegulatory Guide 1.99 describes two acceptable methods for determining the upper\nshelf energy values for RPV beltline materials.\nBecause the reactor vessel upper shelf energy limit will be exceeded prior to the end of\nthe extended period of operation, the applicant must provide an analysis in accordance\nwith 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G at least three years prior to exceeding the upper shelf\nenergy limit.\n\n-4-\nPTS Screening Criterion\n.  The applicant predicts the criterion for axial welds and plates\nwill be exceeded in 2014.  10 CFR 50.61 provides the fracture toughness requirements\nfor protecting reactor vessels from the effects of PTS events.  The end of life reference\ntemperature (RT\nPTS\n) value is the sum of a reference value for an unirradiated material, a\nshift in the reference value caused by exposure to high-energy neutron irradiation, and\nan additional margin to account for uncertainties.\nIf an applicant determines that the RPV will not meet the PTS screening criterion\nthrough the end of the facility’s current license term, several actions must be taken.  10\nCFR 50.61(b)(3), requires that an applicant implement a reasonably practicable flux\nreduction program in an effort to avoid exceeding the PTS screening criterion.  If no\nreasonably practicable flux reduction program will meet this objective (as is true in the\ncase of PNP) the applicant has several options.  The applicant may submit a safety\nanalysis in accordance with 10 CFR 50.61(b)(4) to demonstrate that the RPV can be\noperated beyond the 10 CFR 50.61 screening criterion.  This safety analysis may\ninclude plant modifications.  Such an analysis must be submitted three years prior to\nthe time the RPV is projected to exceed the PTS screening criterion.  In accordance\nwith 10 CFR 50.61(b)(7), the applicant could propose to anneal the RPV in order to\nimprove its material properties and permit continued operation.  In accordance with 10\nCFR 50.66, the applicant’s thermal annealing plan would have to be submitted three\nyears prior to when the facility’s RPV is projected to exceed the PTS screening\ncriterion.\nPressure-Temperature Limit Curves\n.   Pressure-temperature limit curves are contained\nin the PNP technical specifications and are assessed against the limits in 10 CFR\n50.60, Appendix G to 10 CFR 50, and Appendix G to Section XI of the ASME Code. \nThe current pressure-temperature limits approved by the staff are valid beyond the\ncurrent license term, but not through the extended period of operation.  Based on the\nneutron fluence expected to be accumulated, the pressure-temperature limit curves will\nexpire in 2014.  Prior to entering the period of extended operation, the applicant must\nsubmit an amendment requesting a  technical specification change and approval of new\nlimits covering the period of extended operation beyond 2014.  \nThe staff has concluded that the applicant has provided an adequate list of TLAAs. \nFurther, the staff has concluded that the applicant has met the license renewal rule by\ndemonstrating that the TLAAs have been projected to the end of the period of extended\noperation.  In those cases where the current TLAAs do not cover the entire period of\nextended operation, the applicant must provide additional information in a timely\nmanner and submit a license amendment for a technical specification change to extend\nthese three TLAAs to cover the entire period of extended operation.  We concur with\nthe staff that the applicant has properly identified the applicable TLAAs, reviewed the \n\n-5-\nassociated analyses and licensing bases, and identified those instances where\nadditional measures are needed to modify the TLAAs to cover the entire period of\nextended operation.  We concur with the staff’s conclusions and the resulting license\nconditions and commitments.\nDuring our Plant License Renewal Subcommittee meeting on July 11, 2006, members\nof the Public provided comments and raised several questions.  These  comments and\nquestions were recorded and are contained in the transcript of that meeting.  The\nreference to the transcript that contains these comments and questions was provided to\nthe Executive Director for Operations.  Subsequently, the staff has responded to these\nquestions and comments.\nWe agree with the staff that there are no issues related to the matters described in 10\nCFR 54.29(a)(1) and (a)(2) that preclude renewal of the operating license for PNP.  The\nprograms established and committed to by NMC provide reasonable assurance that\nPNP can be operated in accordance with its current licensing basis for the period of\nextended operation without undue risk to the health and safety of the public.  Continued\noperation during the entire period of extended operation is contingent on the resolution\nof the issues associated with three TLAAs related to RPV integrity.  The NMC\napplication for renewal of the operating license for PNP should be approved.\nSincerely,\n  /RA/\nGraham B.

Dr. Bonaca \nthen called upon NRC staff to begin. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 2 \nApril 9, 2003 \nNRC STAFF INTRODUCTION Mr. P. 1. Kuo \nMr. Kuo noted that there were \n11 open items at the time the draft SER was issued. Since then, \nall these items have been resolved. The staff will discuss the closure \nof these items and the \ninspections performed to support the review \nof the LRA. In addition, the staff will discuss the \nstatus \nof interim staff guidance (ISG) that has either been issued, or is  under review, to \nsupplement the Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) technical reviews. \nFLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT PRESENTATION Mr. Steve Hale \nMr. Hale, License Renewal Manager for FP&L, was responsible for Turkey Point and St. Lucie \nLRAs. FP&L submitted the St. Lucie LRA in  November 2001, and received the renewed \nlicenses for Turkey Point Units 1 and 1 on June \n6, 2002. \nThe technical work performed on-site, was directed by the FP&L procedures used in 1996 in \nsupport \nof the Turkey Point license renewal effort. St. Lucie's PN&Ds, safety analysis report \n(SAR) and design basis documents (DBD) were all used for preparation \nof the LRA. In addition, \nFP&L made information trips to other license renewal applicants that have received a license for \nextended operation (e.g., Oconee). \nThe St. Lucie application format \nis the same format that FP&L used for Turkey Point. The \nmethodology is  described in Section \n2-1 of the LRA is the same as for Turkey Point, and follows \nthe gUidance \nof Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) document 95-10, \"Industry Guideline for \nImplementing The Requirements \nof 10 CFR Part 54 -The License Renewal Rule.\" \nMr. Leitch questioned whether FP&L physically walked-down systems to look for potential \ninteractions in  which non-safety related equipment may affect safety related equipment. Mr. \nHale replied yes walk-downs were performed; that the approach FP&L took for seismic \n1111 \ninteractions was an area-based approach, which included all the non-safety related supports. In \nareas where there was non-safety and safety-related equipment, all \nof the supports and conduit \nwere included. The only thing not included was the pipe because, from a design-basis \nstandpoint, the pipe was never classified that way (Note: FP&L did eventually bring segments \nof \nthe pipe into scope due to seismic 1111 concerns). Mr. Hale added that there was quite a bit of \nfield work involved in developing the LRA. \nMr. Rosen questioned which drawings were used to determine which non-safety related \nsystems can affect safety systems, adding that just marking P&IDs would not seem to be \nadequate because P&IDs do not accurately represent the lengths \nof piping and component \npositions. Mr. Hale acknowledged that was true and pointed out that, because \nof that issue, \nFP&L physically designated areas that were in  scope. For example, at \nSt. Lucie, there is a room \nwhich has some swinging switch gear on the 19-5 foot-level, where engineers actually wrote \non \na wall stating that \"non-safety related pipe in  AB switch gear room,\" \nMr. Rosen questioned whether isometric drawings were used at all. Mr. Hale replied no, \nbecause when coupled with on-site inspections and engineering walk-downs, P&IDs were \nadequate for that aging management program. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 3 \nApril 9. 2003 \nWhen reviewing the regulated events, there was some other documentation used. FP&L has a \ncontrol document called the \"Appendix R Safe Shut-Down List.\" In addition, there \nis an item \ncalled the \"Essential Equipment List; EO List,\" which \nis derived from the FP&L component \ndatabase. \nIn summary, for the scoping \nof systems and structures for St. Lucie, FP&L identified 39 out of 70 \nsystems were in scope, and \n16 out of the 46 structures on-site were in scope. \nIn screening, the purpose is to identify structures and components which require \nan aging \nmanagement review. The criteria FP&L used was component-level scoping. Once the entire \nstructures in the scope have been identified, then the structure systems are scoped down to the \ncomponent level,  and screened to determine whether it is passive or not and whether it is long­\nlived or not. \nIn the mechanical area, FP&L established evaluation boundaries and interfaces with other \nsystems to ensure it captured everything. Specific structures and components were identified \nthat were included in  the systems evaluation boundaries. FP&L reviewed the intended \nfunctions, and then identified which structures and components supported those functions from \na passive standpoint and whether they were long-lived. \nMr. Leitch stated that he was concerned that electronic components (e.g., power supplies) are \nconsidered active and are eliminated during the screening process. However, in revieWing \nindustry operating experience there appears to be a growing trend \nof plant upset conditions \n(e.g., scrams) that are the result \nof failed electronic components. Some of these electrical \ncomponents are active \nin a sense that the failure can be detected by maintenance procedures \nand surveillance tests, however, some \nof them are revealed only in failure which can scram the \nplant, or cause some other kind \nof upset conditions. Mr. Leitch questioned whether, \nindependent \nof license renewal, there is some kind of a program to assess which electronic \ncomponents whose failure could, all by itself, cause an undesirable chain \nof events. Mr. Hale \nresponded yes, there are breaker programs which perform preventative maintenance breakers \nat FP&L. Active electrical components receive a lot of attention. FP&L also has some strategic \nplans looking at obsolescence \nof instrumentations and controls at St. Lucie and Turkey Point in \nterms \nof long-term life cycle management. Electrical components are also included in  the \nmaintenance rule monitoring specifically related to some \nof those active components and \nsystems. \nDr. Bonaca noted that \nhe was reviewing the pressurizer spray system and the screening \nprocess concluded that the pressurizer spray head should not be \nin scope. The reason given \nwas that the function \nof the spray head is enhancing the efficiency of the spray and that St. \nLucie can survive a fire event where the pressurizer spray is for protection purposes, however, \nthe event can be mitigated without the enhanced effect \nof the spray head. Dr. Bonaca \nquestioned whether FP&L performs any inspection \nof the spray head because the component is \nsubjected to significant thermal cycles and, therefore, subject to breaking or cracking over 60 \nyears. Mr. Hale stated that FP&L took the position that the Westinghouse Owner Group \noriginally took in its topical report (which was also used at Turkey Point). The aging effect is \nthermal embrittlement \nof stainless, not the fatigue issue. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 4 \nApril 9, 2003 \nDr. Wallis asked what the definition of long-lived is. Mr. Hale responded that around 40 years is \nthe criteria used by FP&L. \nMr. Hale stated that \nin the electrical and instrument and control (I&C) area FP&L took a slightly \ndifferent approach to improve the efficiency its review. FP&L eliminated the active components \nup front because because 95% \nof the electrical components are active. For example the first \ntime the engineers performed did a component download \non our 40-volt system at Turkey Point, \nthere were 18,000 components. It made more sense to eliminate the active categories up front \nand then deal with the passive components. One point to make clear for electrical components \nis that if something was \nin the environmental qualification (EQ) program, it is replaced on a \nqualified life. So even though some \nof these components may be greater than 40 years, the fact \nthat it is \nin the EQ program allowed the engineers to eliminate it as a long-lived item. This is \nconsistent with what previous utilities have done for license renewal. \nThe screening results are summarized \nin Chapter 2 of the LRA and the details are presented in \nChapter 3. There are four mechanical sections: rack and cooling system, connective systems, \nESF, auxiliary systems, and steam and power conversion. In  the structural area and the \nelectrical area FP&L provided license renewal boundary drawings to facilitate the NRC review \nthe LRA and also included a SAR and boundary drawings. \nMr. Hale next discussed the aging management review (AMR) which demonstrated that the \neffects of aging will be adequately managed so the intended functions will be maintained \nconsistent with the current licensing basis (CLB) for the extended period \nof operation. Aging \neffects requiring management were established based on two primary areas: 1} the AMR \ntechnical resources available, and 2} operating experience reviews. The methodology used for \ndetermining the aging effects requiring management for non-Class I \nin the civil and structural \narea is  provided \nin Appendix C of the LRA. This is an approach that was originally developed by \nthe Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) owner's group. It was then adopted by the other owner's groups \nand controlled by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) as the standardized tool for the \nindustry to utilize. \nEven though St. Lucie is not a Westinghouse plant, there \nis a lot of good information that was \ndeveloped \nin Westinghouse generic technical reports. In addition, the original NUMARC license \nrenewal industry reports were used as well as B&W technical reports. FP&L established a large \ndatabase from the Turkey Point aging management reviews that was used for St. Lucie as well \nas the GALL report. There are some unique materials at St. Lucie and, therefore, the engineers \nused materials handbooks and in-house materials expertise to address those issues. \nMr. Rosen requested more information on some unique materials at St. Lucie. Mr. Hale \nresponded that the Unit 1 refueling water tank (RWT) is  aluminum. There was no industry \ninformation for the use of aluminum \nin this application so FP&L had to research the aging effect \nof sodium hydroxide on stainless steel. Mr. Rosen questioned what sort \nof metallurgical issues \nwere there with the aluminum Unit 1 RWT, and what evidence is there that it will last for 60 \nyears. Mr. Hale stated that FP&L had confidence \nin the tank because there is a program to \ninspect that tank regularly. There is  an epoxy coating on the bottom that has to be inspected \nthat is identified \nin the LRA. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 5 \nApril 9, 2003 \nDr. Ford stated that the St. Lucie galvanic-aging program makes the case for one-time \ninspections \nof various structures based on an algorithm which takes into account galvanic \nseries. \nDr. Ford questioned whether the algorithm had been tested against observation, and \ncould it have predicted this galvanic corrosion \nof this aluminum in the Unit 1 RWT. Mr. Hale \nclarified that the galvanic program \nis where there are dissimilar metals in treated water systems. \nThat it is  a one-time inspection. Mr. Menocal added that the galvanic corrosion \nin the RWT for \nUnit 1 was at the tank bottom where there is  a galvanic couple on one \nof the lines coming in. \nThe corrective action was installation \nof a liner. \nDr. Ford requested more on this particular incident with the RWT noting that he has a concern \nabout one-time inspections used to predict the validity \nof algorithms. Where is  the evidence that \nthis methodology is  quantitatively correct? \nIf you want to have one inspection to support \nextending the operating license from 40 to 60 years, that inspection better be at the right place \nat the right time. Mr. Hale noted that one-time inspections are performed \nin areas where aging \neffects are not expected to be found. If aging effects are found, then part \nof the corrective action \nmay be to require additional inspections. Mr. Menocal added that since there are hundreds \nof \npotential inspection sites, FP&L is  trying to limit its inspections by systematically identifying the \nmost limiting locations based on the galvanic series, the electrolyte, and the contact area \nbetween the anodic and cathodic materials. \nDr. Ford stated that to make sure that the decision algorithm is  correct FP&L must go beyond \nthat boundary and take into account areas which have undergone the galvanic corrosion such \nas the RWT. Dr. Ford again questioned whether the algorithm used, predicted the corrosion \nin \nthe RWT. Mr. Hale replied that he was not sure a galvanic program would identify the RWT \ncorrosion. Dr. Ford noted that, that was the point he was trying to make. \nDr. Bonaca noted that the intake cooling water inspection identified a lot of small-bore piping that \nhad corroded \nin the past 20 years and that FP&L has replaced 75 percent of it with a corrosion­\nresistant material. However, there is  still 25 percent of the original. The LRA states, and the \nNRC accepted, that \nin the future, FP&L only is  required inspect the connections between the \nsmall-bore piping and the large-bore piping. \nDr. Bonaca questioned why the other 25 percent \nthat has not replaced should not be inspected. Mr. Hale stated that FP&L determined that \nleakage inspections were adequate aging management programs for those nozzles. The \nproblem is  inspection techniques cannot get inside \nof that pipe. These are small-bore pipes. We \ncan look at the connection, and that, typically, will be worst case. A combination of the crawl­\nthrough inspections are used \nin addition to periodic leakage inspections externally. The basis \nfor saying leakage inspections are acceptable is  that it  is  an open-cooling water system, and \nthere is  margin. As a result \nof St. Lucie operating experience if there is  a leak, it is  small, not \ncatastrophic. \nMr. Hale continued with the presentation noting that \nin Chapter 3 of the LRA components \ngrouped the same way they were presented \nin Chapter 2. The results are presented in six­\ncolumn tables. These are consistent with what FP&L prepared for Turkey Point. The basis for \nthe aging effects \nfor the non-Class' are described in Appendix C of the LRA. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 6 \nApril 9, 2003 \nFor the GALL comparisons FP&L flagged differences between the component listing in GALL \nversus the St. Lucie component listing. In general, FP&L listed what the differences \nin materials \nin internal and external environments between GALL and St. Lucie. \nMr. Beisler, a civil engineer for FPL stated that the staff asked FP&L to address two questions \nregarding the aging concrete, specifically the concrete below ground water. One had to do with \nphosphates and how that affects the concrete, and the second one has to do with corrosion of \nrebar and how that is managed. \nDuring the license renewal process, FP&L had not come across any issues associated with the \nphosphates \nin the soil or the ground water affecting our buried concrete. FP&L did review the \ntechnical documentation \nin an attempt to identify find any information regarding phosphates. \nIn general, there was no limitations on phosphates in the American Concrete Institute (ACI) \ndocuments that FP&L reviewed. \nIn addition, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers \n(ASME) Code Section III requirements for concrete reactor vessels and containments contained \nno information \non phosphates. The American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) \nstandards for the constituent materials for the concrete, the cement, the aggregates, did not \ncontain limitations even \non phosphates in the constituent materials. The EPRI documents that \naddress license renewal also did not discuss any aging effects due to phosphates. \nNext, FP&L contacted an expert at a large architectural and engineering firm who also could not \nfind information \nin the technical documents regarding how phosphates affect concrete. The \nexpert did some quick research and provided a brief write-up on what he was able to find. \nBasically, the expert found that phosphates are not very soluble \nin water in all ranges of pH, \nwhich \nis contrary to what you find with chlorides and sulfates, which are the main culprits in \nconcrete degradation. Those are very soluble, so they are able to penetrate into the concrete, \nespecially lesser-grade concretes and cause degradation. Additionally, he told us that typical \nranges \nof phosphates and soil or ground water in the neighborhood of 500 to 100 PPM total \nphosphates, but most \nof that is fixed, meaning that it cannot be transported to the concrete to \ncause the degradation. \nNearly all the water soluble phosphates are converted to non-soluble shortly after, \nif they do \ncome into contact with the concrete, shortly after they are not able to penetrate into the \nconcrete. \nOf course, the phosphates, in general, are not harmful to the rebar. If there was any \neffect, it would affect the high alkalinity \nof concrete. So expert's conclusion, based on his \nresearch, supported the industry technical documents that the phosphates are not a contributor \nto degradation \nof concrete. \nFor the St. Lucie plant, FP&L recognized from the very beginning that the ground water was \naggressive. The chlorides are higher than the pUblished thresholds. The sulfates are higher \nthan the published thresholds, so FP&L recognized from the very beginning that it  needed to \nmanage our concrete below ground water and stated that \nin the LRA. \nMr. Kobetz requested a copy of the paper that the expert prepared for FP&L on phosphates. \nMr. Beisler responded that it is not a published paper, rather something that the expert put \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 7 \nApril 9, 2003 \ntogether very quickly based on some quick research, and discussions with some university \nprofessors. Mr. Kobetz recommended FP&L consider trying to provide something prior to the \nfull Committee Meeting \nin an effort shorten the discussions in this area. \nMr. Seisler noted that the way to prevent the corrosion \nof rebar is  with the use of high-quality \nconcrete. FP&L reviewed ACI \n201 which recommend a water/cement ratio less than 0.45 for \ndurability. St. Lucie structures exposed to ground water were all speci'fied at less than or equal \nor 0.44. \nThe AC1201, dated 1977, recommends the ASTM C150 type five cement. However, the \nconstruction of St. Lucie predated 1977 and used type two cement, which was the preferred \ncement at that time for sulfate resistance. Also, the ACI document recommends an appropriate \nair entrapment be used; for St. Lucie, the range of air entrapment was two and a half to nine­\npercent based \non what size aggregate is  used in the concrete. This all met the ACI \nrequirements. \nIn  addition, the ACI document recommends the following: moist curing for seven days, and St. \nLucie required seven to 14 days; high-quality constituent materials, including aggregates per the \nASTM C33, cement, ASTM C150, and very clean water, and all those are included \nin the St. \nLucie concrete; and one and a half or, preferably, two inches \nof concrete cover. St. Lucie \nstructures all have a minimum \nof three inches, and, in fact, the structures that are exposed to \nground water have even more cover, in some cases up to five or six inches \nof cover, which is \nspecified on the individual drawings for the specific structures. \nConcrete exposed to salt water should have a 28-day strength of, at least, 5,000 PSI. For St. \nLucie Unit \n1, the specification required 4,000 PSI, but the actual strengths of the concrete \nbreaks, \nin general, were all over 5,000 PSI. \nMr. Seisler also noted that there is  a program that includes visual inspections \nof exposed interior \nand exterior surfaces \nof the concrete looking for signs of degradations, specifically corrosion of \nthe rebar, in which case you would see cracking, rust staining possibly, and spalling, although, \nusually, it never gets to that point. The program now includes inspections \nof buried structures, \nwhich are excavated for whatever reason. \nMr. Hale noted that for each aging effect requiring management, FP&L identified aging \nmanagement programs on a component basis. Supporting that is  an evaluation on-site which \ngoes through an assessment \nof the GALL attributes versus FP&L program attributes, as well as \nthe general program description and the criteria for the program. Those are documented \nin \nprogram basis documents on-site. \nMr. Leitch questioned whether St. Lucie will be able to fully comply with the new NRC Order \nrelated to vessel head penetration inspections. There is a plant similar to St. Lucie that is having \nsome difficulty fully complying with that order because \nit, and St. Lucie, have guide sleeves or \nthermal sleeves \nin the CRDM penetrations, that make it  difficult obtain the required data. Mr. \nHale responded that St. Lucie has the guide sleeves \non Unit 1, and, in anticipation of that \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 8 \nApril 9, 2003 \nquestion, Mr. Hale provided Mr. Leitch the 3D-day inspection report that was issued after the 100 \npercent visual inspection was completed. FP&L performed a  100 percent visual and 100 \npercent ultrasonic test on Unit 1 last refueling outage, and the 3D-day report to summarizes the \nfindings. There was no indication \nof leakage, and  no indications of cracking on Unit 1. Unit 2 \ndoes not have these types of sleeves. \nMr. Leitch questioned whether a decision has been made whether to replace the reactor vessel \nhead at St. Lucie. Mr. Hale stated no decision has been made for St. Lucie, however, at Turkey \nPoint, the heads will be replaced in 2004 and 2005, even though there has not been an \nindication \nof leakage. \nMr. Hale next discussed various aging management programs for St. Lucie including the flow \naccelerated corrosion program, the reactor vessel internals program, and the Alloy 600 \nprogram. \nMr. Rosen questioned whether the reactor vessel internals program evaluates how well repairs \nmade to the reactor vessel will perform over the extended license term. Mr. Hale replied no, \nhowever, the program goes beyond what must be performed \nin accordance with ASME Code \nSection XI. St. Lucie is already committed under ASME Code Section XI to perform inspections \nand follow-up with regard to the barrel repairs. The reactor vessel internals program addresses \nsome \nof the more research-type issues, such as the effect of radiation embrittlement, radiation­\nassisted primary water, there is a whole series of items right now that are being investigated \nunder the MRP. \nIn conclusion, the aging management programs at \nSt. Lucie, have demonstrated they'll manage \nthe aging effects, so the intended functions will \nbe maintained consistent with our CLB. For all \nthe time-limited aging analyses (TLAA) for St. Lucie have been evaluated and shown to be \nacceptable for the extended period of operation. \nNRC STAFF OVERVIEW OF THE SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT AND STATUS OF OPEN \nITEMS Mr. Noel Dudley and Mr. James Medoff \nNoel Dudley, project manager for the St. Lucie license renewal application, provided a brief \noverview \nof the staff's presentation noting that the staff will present the status of the open and \nconfirmatory items and summarize the scoping and screening methodology and the scoping and \nscreening results. The staff will also present the aging management program inspections; \nconcrete aging, as requested by the ACRS members. The staff will conclude its presentation by \nexplaining the Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) process and will provide the status \nof the identified \nISG issues. \nSt. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant Units 1 and 2 are Combustion Engineering plants with large dry \ncontainments. Unit 1 is  seven years older than Unit \n2, which resulted in some design \ndifferences between the units. \nThe St. Lucie process and programs which are associated with license renewal are similar to \nthose used for Turkey Point. The differences between the designs \nof the Combustion \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 9 \nApril 9, 2003 \nEngineering plant and the Westinghouse plant introduces some unique aging management and \nTLAA. \nWhen the staff received the St. Lucie license renewal application, they reviewed the application \nin detail and developed the draft request for additional information (RAJ) concerning verification \nand clarification \nof information in the application. After meeting and discussing the draft RAl's \nwith the application, the staff issued the RAls that were required for completing the review. The \napplicant than submitted responses to these RAls. \nIn some cases, additional meetings were held to discuss the draft responses. As a result \nof \nthese meetings, the applicant revised the draft RAI responses before they were submitted to the \nNRC. On the basis \nof the information in the license renewal application and in  the RAt \nresponses, the staff prepared the SER with open items. Since issuing the SER with open items, \nthe staff has continued its discussion with the application to resolve the open items. Once all the \nopen items and confirmatory items are resolved, the staff will issue a final SER, which will \nprovide the basis \nfor issuing the license renewal. \nThe staff and the applicant have expended significant time and effort \nin this review process. The \napplicant used the lessons learned from its Turkey Point LRA when they prepared the St. Lucie \napplication. About 70 fewer RAl's were issued during the St. Lucie license renewal application \nreview as were issued for the Turkey Point review. \nAs a result \nof the NRC staff review, new components or commodity groups were identified and \nsubject to an aging management review. \nOf these, about 75 components required aging \nmanagement programs. \nIn response to one RAI, the applicant created a new aging \nmanagement program. \nThe NRC staff conducted one audit and two inspections to verify information contained in  the \napplication were \nin responses to the RAls. \nThere were \n11 open items identified in the SER with open items. Since the SER was issued the \nstaff has reached resolution on all \nof these items. \nIn one open item the staff questioned the management of wall thinning due to internal corrosion \nof small-bore piping in  the fire-protection system. For previous applications, the staff accepted \naging management programs that included volumetric inspection \nof these lines. The fire \nprotection system is  supplied by city water, and the applicant's monitors internal piping \nconditions via pressure tests, leakage tests, and identification \nof excessive corrosion products \nduring flushing \nof the systems. Past operating experience has not identified any degraded \nconditions \nof the internal surfaces, and during recent modifications of the system, the applicant \nobtained ultrasonic pipe wall-thickness measurements on stagnant portions \nof the system. The \nmeasured wall thicknesses were apprOXimately nominal. Based upon a nominal wall thickness \nin the measured wall thicknesses, the applicant determined a worst-case corrosion rate might \nhave occurred over the last 24 years \nof operation. The applicant then used the worst-case \ncorrosion rate and calculated the pipe wall thickness at the end \nof the period of extended \noperations and found the wall thickness would be greater than the ASME B31.1 Code \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 10 \nApril 9, 2003 \nrequirements for a minimum wall thickness. Therefore, based on the volumetric measurements \nand the corrosion rate calculations, this item was resolved. \nDr. Bonaca questioned whether the program will rely on the identification of leakage. Mr. Dudley \nresponded not \nin this case. Mr. Hale added that with regard to ultrasonic as related to wet pipe \nsystems that are pressurized all the time, like fixed sprinkler systems and that sort \nof thing, if any \nleakage is  detected that would be an indication that was a problem, that would be corrected \nunder the fire protection program. There \nis still quite a bit that needs to be done under the fire \nprotection program, \nin terms of monitoring fixed systems, testing pumps, ensuring that flows \nrates produce the right pressure at the far end of the system. Mr. Rajan, NRC staff pointed out, \nthat the staff based their acceptance primarily on the flushing pressure testing and performance \ntesting, but this was one \nof the areas where the flow testing was not being conducted, so the \nstaff questioned the licensee how it verified the acceptability \nof the wall thickness in those areas. \nThe applicant performed a one-time inspection and based a an estimated corrosion rate based \non the performance \nof that line and projected it out, it was determined that there was sufficient \nmargin. The staff accepted that conclusion. \nMr. Dudley continued noting that the staff questioned FP&L's management \nof wall thinning in \nsmall-bore pipes in the intake cooling water system. The environment of the small-bore pipes is \nstagnant sea water. The staff also questioned the possibility \nof common mode failure of the \nsmall-bore pipe during a seismic event. \nIn its response to the RAI, and in discussions with the \nstaff, the applicant indicated the following: that there are crawl-through inspections \nof the \nmajority of the intake cooling water (ICW) systems line pipes, which include, approximately 80 \npercent of the pipes \nin the system. The inspection also included as much of each branch line as \npossible. The branch lines consist of welded flanges to which small-bore piping is  attached. \nThe flanges are the most susceptible location for the development of corrosion cells since there \nis a break in the epoxy lining where the flange and pipe come together. \nThe applicant has established a program to replace small bore epoxy-lined carbon steel pipes \nwith a more corrosive-resistant material. To date, the applicant has replaced approximately \n75% \nof the carbon steel pipes with the more resistant material. \nAs part \nof the normal shift activities, operators walk down the ICW system, note any leaks, and \ninitiate corrective action. The ICW system \nis an open system and is designed to perform its \nintended function with a sheered three-quarter inch instrument line and an additional hundred­\ngallon-per-minute leak. The maintenance history indicates that the localized failure \nof cement \nlinings and internal epoxy coating of intake cooling water lines result \nin small corrosion cells that \nlead to two-wall leakage. The system and structures monitoring program and the ICW \ninspection programs are adequate to manage internal corrosion \nin the ICW piping. The staff \nconsiders this item resolved. \nDr. Bonaca again questioned 25 percent of the piping that has not been replaced. Mr. Hale \nreplied that FP&L credited two aging management programs for aging of the small-bore lines. \nOne \nis internal visual crawl-through inspections of the larger ICW piping; and the other is \nleakage inspection. The basis behind that is  part \nof the corrective action for the other lines be \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 11 \nApril 9, 2003 \nestablished an acceptance criteria that says we can allow a certain amount of leakage, so if a \nleak is  detected, it will be repaired. \nDr. Bonaca questioned why the remaining 25 percent \nof the piping was not replaced. Mr. Hale \nresponded that part \nof it that this system is  operating all the time, even during an outage. It is \ndifficult to replace the piping unless the system \nis out of service. Therefore, based on operating \nexperience leakage has been small, where the system safety function \nis not affected, FP&L will \nessentially go into a corrective maintenance mode for these small-bore lines. \nMr. Dudley continued the discussion stating that, as a result \nof industry experience with the \nunexpected aging degradation \nof Alloy 600 materials and Alloy 182 materials, the staff is \ndeveloping guidance and requirements for managing these aging effects. To ensure applicants \ncomply with future staff guidance, the staff requested a commitment from the applicants. The \napplicant committed to implement the commitments made \nin response to NRC bulletins and any \nfurther NRC communications associated with primary water stress, corrosion, cracking, and \nnickel-based alloy components. Therefore, the staff considers this item \nis resolved. \nDr. Ford noted that there are numerous degradation modes for Alloy 600, 690, and 182, and \nquestioned whether the staff took into account whether some \nof these components had already \nbeen repaired as a possible indicator \nof future failures. The staff responded yes, the staff had \nthe same concerns. NRC Bulletins 02-01, 02-02, and 01-01 are specific to primary water stress, \ncorrosion, cracking that occurs \nin the upper vessel head. The bulletins do not address industry \nexperience \nin other Class I Inconellocations. Therefore, the staff divided the open item in two; \none open item on the vessel heads and one open item on the remaining components. Basically, \nthe second open item requested clarification on which additional Inconel components are \ncovered by the scope of your program and how will they be inspected. FP&L provided the \nlocations and clarified that it was only using the current ASME Code Section \nXI programs. \nDepending on whether it is  a nozzle joined by a partial penetration weld \nor an Alloy 182 safe end \nnozzle weld, which is  a full-penetration weld, the ASME Code Section \nXI requirements are \nslightly different and may require a surface inspection, volumetric inspection, or a combination \nof \nthe two. For the partial penetration welds, only leakage tests and VT-2 visual examinations are \nrequired. \nMr. Dudley continued with the presentation noting that the applicant plans to use risk informed \nmethodologies for the one-time small-bore Class I piping inspection. The applicant confirmed \nthat the risk informed methodologies will not \nbe used to eliminate volumetric inspection of weld. \nThe applicant committed to provide the NRC an inspection plan, prior to the period \nof extended \noperations, that describes the risk inform methodology and addresses how the methodology will \nbe used to determine the location and the number \nof small-bore piping components for \ninspection. This commitment will be included \nas part of the UFSAR supplement. \nDr. Bonaca questioned whether the inspections would be one-time inspections. Mr. Dudley \nreplied, yes. The details \nof the program will be provided prior to the period of extended \noperation. The applicant has committed to include specific information \nin that program \ndescription for staff approval. FP&L clarified that the Class I small-bore inspection program \nof \nASME Code Section XI currently only requires visual inspection of small-bore piping. The \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 12 \nApril 9, 2003 \nconcern raised by the staff is  that there needs to be some volumetric inspection of the small­\nbore piping, \nin addition to ASME Code Section XI. Based on FP&L's aging assessment it did \nnot anticipate finding any degradation in this piping. So FP&L committed, as other applicants \nhave, to performing a one-time volumetric inspection, \nin addition to the ongoing visual \ninspections performed under ASME Code Section XI. Risk is  used to establish the locations of \nthe ultrasonic (volumetric) inspections in the small-bore piping. Dr. Bonaca asked what the \napplicant will do if the inspections identify sections \nof degraded piping that are not in a risk \nsignificant location, but are \nin a susceptible location. Mr. Hale responded that FP&L would take \nspecific corrective action, which may include replacing the piping or additional inspections \nincluding vOlumetric inspections. \nMr. Dudley noted that, next, the staff questioned the applicant's basis for not managing stress \nrelaxation for non-Class I bolting material. Non-Class I bolting does experience stress relaxation \nat temperatures above 700 degrees Fahrenheit. The non-Class I bolts at St. Lucie are \nenvironments that have temperatures below the 700 degrees Fahrenheit (by approximately 200­\n300 degrees Fahrenheit), and, therefore, do not require an aging management program specific \nto stress relaxation. Mr. Medoff added that when the staff performed its review it noticed the \napplicant has one global aging effect, which is  loss of closure integrity, and the applicant \nevaluated it for different degradation mechanisms, such as severe corrosion \nor cracking or \nstress relaxation. During the review, the staff noticed that the applicant's identification of this \naging effect for the non-Class I was handled slightly differently. The applicant did not identify \nstress relaxation as a mechanism leading to the loss of closure integrity. In response to an open \nitem on this matter, the applicant provided the threshold for stress relaxation for the different \nmaterials for the Class I \nin contrast to the materials used for the non-Class I reactor coolant \nsystem (RCS) bolting. To confirm the validity \nof the responses, the staff reviewed the \nappropriate ASME Code section and confirmed the ASME Code thresholds for stress relaxation \nin the different materials. Therefore, based on the use of 700 degrees Fahrenheit as the \nthreshold for stress relaxation and Grade B-7 bolting, which is  being used for the non-Class I \nRCS bolting, the staff confirmed that stress relaxation would not be an applicable effect for those \nbolting materials because the operation of the RCS would \nbe at a temperature lower than that. \nProbably around 560-600 degrees Fahrenheit, so maybe 100-140 degrees Fahrenheit and the \nbolts are actually cooler than that. \nMr. Dudley noted that the staff questioned the applicant's basis for not managing possible crack \npropagation from Alloy 182 welds \nin the base metal of the pressurizer nozzles and thermal \nsleeves. The thermal sleeves are not welded and do not perform a pressure boundary function. \nThe thermal sleeves are machined, inserted, and expanded. Therefore, since there are no \nwelds, there is  no possibility of crack propagation to the base material that forms the pressure \nboundary, and this item is  resolved. \nIn ISG-5, \"Identification and Treatment of Electrical Fuse Holders for License Renewal,\" the \nstaff stated that the fuse holders are considered passive electrical components and should \nbe \nbrought into scope of license renewal and subject to an aging management review. The \napplicant identified electrical boxes that contain fuses that were brought within scope. The fuse \nholders are located \nin electrical boxes in the electrical equipment rooms in the Unit 1 and Unit 2 \nreactor auxiliary buildings. The applicant conducted \nan aging management review of the effects \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 13 \nApril 9, 2003 \nof aging stressers, such as vibration, thermal cycling, electrical transients, mechanical stress, \nfatigue, corrosion, chemical contamination, and oxidation \nof connecting surfaces. The applicant \nconcluded that no aging management programs are required. The staff performed an extensive \nreview \nof this since this is  the first LRA that addresses ISG-5; some of the things that the staff \ntook into consideration when they reached the acceptance \nof the applicant's position was that \nthe fuse holders are installed \nin parallel with breakers to address regulatory guide associated \nwith providing double isolation for non-safety-related loads powered from safety-related power \nsupplies. The non-safety related  loads include instrumentation and heater strips to electrical \npanels. The fuse holder clips are made \nof copper or a copper alloy plated with a corrosion­\nresistant material, either tin \nor silver, and the fuse holders are in a mild, non-air-conditioned \nenvironment, and the staff was unable to identify any aging effects that would degrade the \nperformance \nof the fuse holder. On this basis, the staff considers this item resolved. \nThe last open item, involves instances \nin which the St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 have experienced \nAlloy 500 instrument nozzle leakage. Four Unit 2 pressurizers steam space instrument nozzles \nand one Unit 1 reactor coolant system hot leg instrument nozzle were repaired with a half-nozzle \nrepair technology. A  mechanical analysis was submitted to support the St. Lucie Unit 2 \npressurizer steam space half-nozzle repair performed \nin 1994. The staff is  currently reviewing \nseveral aspects \nof the half-nozzle repair and associated topical reports. The staff is evaluating \nthe acceptability \nof leaving the half-nozzle repairs in place due to the unknown effects of primary \ncoolant contacting the ferritic material \nof the nozzles (this is  a follow-up action to concerns \nidentified at Davis Besse). The staff is  reviewing a regulatory relief request from FP&L for \nleaving the half-nozzle repair \nin place for one cycle while Combustion Engineering assesses \ncalculational errors \nin its topical report associated with the fracture mechanical analysis \nsupporting half-nozzle repairs. The topical report \nis currently being reviewed by the staff. \nThe applicant also submitted a site-specific calculation for evaluating the crack growth \nassociated with small-diameter nozzles for St. Lucie Units 1 and \n2, and that's also under review \nby the staff. \nSince the technical issues associated with the half-nozzle repairs have not been resolved for the \ncurrent period of operations, the applicant cannot demonstrate that the fatigue analysis can be \nre-evaluated for the period \nof extended operations. The staff has not yet determined what is \nappropriate for a 40-year time period. Therefore, the staff cannot extend that calculation to the \n50-year time period at this time. However, the applicant committed to implement any further \nNRC requirements associated with half-nozzle repairs and, on the basis \nof this commitment, this \nissue is  resolved for license renewal. Again, the staff will rely on the 10 CFR Part 50 operating \nlicense for resolution \nof the adequacy of the half-nozzle repairs. \nMr. Dudley reviewed the findings of the reactor oversight process for St. Lucie. The \nperformance indicators for St. Lucie were last updated \nin December 2002. All the indicators are \ngreen. St. Lucie has had two trips \nin past year. In October of 2000, there was a manual re-trip. \nBased on the loss \nof condenser vacuum. Operators were re-aligning the condenser vacuum \nsystem and, due to the misalignment, they lost pressure. \nIn April 2003, there was a reactor trip \nduring start-up when an auxiliary feed pump was started and tripped (most likely due to low \nsteam generator water level). Neither \nof these events were recognized as a regulatory problem, \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 14 \nApril 9, 2003 \nand there was no non-cited violations issued in  response to the trips in  either case. There were \nseveral events \nof not following your radiological control programs. There was one instance of \nradioactive material (a hot particle) being carried off-site. \nSCOPING AND SCREENING METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS Mr. Greg Galletti and Mr. Noel \nDudley \nMr. Galletti, an operations engineer in  the Equipment and Human Performance Branch, NRR, \nbriefly explained the staff's audit \nof the scoping and screening methodology and the audit \nperformed as part \nof that review process. \nThe team consists \nof three members to perform the audit. In preparation for the audit, the team \nconducts a procedures documentation review trip to the applicant's facility to gather information \npertaining to the LRA. At that time the team assembles design basis documentation (OBO), \nscoping and screening result reports, and any other design basis information that may help the \nteam review the LRA and review the process that the applicant used to determine what systems \nare in  scope and, ultimately, what structures and components are then subject to aging \nmanagement review. \nThe team spends several weeks performing a conservative desktop review. The team reviews \nhow the application is  structured in reference to the requirements \nof the 10 CFR Part 54 to \nensure SSC's have been appropriately identified. \nOnce the desktop review is  complete, the team returns to the applicant's facility for a full week to \nreview in  detail the implemented guidelines. In this case, the applicant assembled a suite \nof \nprocedures called engineering instructions that were written and implemented in  accordance \nwith the FP&L 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix \nB, quality assurance program. \nAs part \nof the review, the team reviewed each of those procedures in  detail with the cognizant \nFP&L engineers for that particular discipline. The team then selected certain systems to review. \nThe team normally reviews four mechanical systems initially: component cooling water; safety \ninjection; auxiliary feed water; and main feed water and then main steam and condensate. \nThere are several reasons the team selects these systems. First, there is  a combination \nof both \nsafety and non-safety related systems. Second, they are robust and complicated systems. \nThird, there is  a lot \nof interface between some of these systems. \nThe team found that the applicant's implementation guidance was very well constructed, \ndetailed, robust, and provided guidance necessary for its staff to implement their process. \nMr. Rosen questioned whether it was unusual for applicants to perform these reviews under \nprocedures that are controlled by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix \nB. Mr. Galletti responded no, \nhowever, some previous applicants have chosen not to perform it under their Appendix B \nprogram. Mr. Rosen and Mr. Leitch added that it was not clear how an applicant could choose \nnot to follow its Appendix B program and that this was a concern they would like to pursue with \nthe staff. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 15 \nApril 9, 2003 \nThe team identified one major issue regarded the 10 CFR 50.54(a)(2) seismic 11/1 issue. Initially, \nthe applicant had performed an internal evaluation \nof what it  characterized as A2 issues (the \neffect \nof non-safety SSCs on safety-related SSCs). After lengthy discussions with the applicant, \nadditional systems were brought into scope. \nIn summary, the team determined that that there was reasonable assurance that the applicant's \nmethodology for scoping and screening was appropriate. \nMr. Dudley next provided a brief overview of the scoping and screening results and the aging \nmanagement review process. The purpose \nof the staffs review of the results of the applicant's \nscoping and screening methodology is to verify that the applicant has properly implemented its \nmethodology. The staff focuses its review on the methodology results. To confirm that there is \nno omission of the plant-level systems and structures within the scope \nof license renewal and \nthat there is \nno omission of mechanical systems and components, structures, or electrical and \nI&C components, they are subject to \nan aging management review. \nTo conduct its review, the staff used guidance from the license renewal standard review plan \nand ISGs. The staff reviewed system drawings indicating license renewal boundaries, previous \nlicense renewal application reviews, and information \nin the updated safety evaluation reports to \nverify there were no omissions \nin the applicant's results. The staff's review confirmed that the \napplicant's responses to ISGs concerning station blackout, seismic \n11/1 issue, and ventilation fan \ndamper housings did not omit any structures \nor components that should be taken into \nconsideration for license renewal. The staff concluded that there is  reasonable assurance that \nthe applicant has appropriately identified components subject to an AMR \nin accordance with the \nrequirements stated in 10 CFR 54.21 (a)(1). \nThe purpose \nof the staffs review of the applicant's aging management review results is  to verify \nthe applicant has identified the appropriate aging management program for the various \ncombinations \nof materials, environments, and aging effects associated with the structures and \ncomponents that are within the scope of license renewal. \nIn this case, the staff used eXisting regulatory requirements or gUidance to reach a conclusion \non the appropriateness of the aging management program identified by the applicant. Since the \napplicant did not claim credit for its aging management reviews being consistent with the GALL \nreport, the staff did not reference the GALL reports \nin its evaluation of the aging management \nreview results. However, \nin some cases, the staff used the technical information in the GALL \nreport to provide justification for the acceptability of the applicant's results. \nThe staff reviewed the aging management program results \nin Chapter 3 of the LRA The staff \nconcluded that the applicant has demonstrated the aging effects associated with different \nstructures and components will be adequately managed. There is  reasonable assurance that \nthe intended function will be \nman~ged consistent with the current licensing basis for the period \nof extended operations, as required by 10 CFR 54.21 (a)(3). \nAGING MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INSPECTIONS AND CONCRETE AGING ISSUES Mr. \nNoel Dudley, Mr. Caudle Julian, and Mr. David Jeng \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 16 \nApril 9, 2003 \nMr. Julian next provided an overview of the license renewal inspection program. For each \ninspection, the staff assembles a site-specific inspection plan that's reviewed and approved \njointly by the region and by NRR. \nIn the case of St. Lucie the staff determined that a follow-up \ninspection \nis not warranted. \nThe objective \nof the scoping and screening inspection is to confirm the applicant included the \nappropriate systems, structures, and components \nin the scope of license renewal. The \ninspection focused on reviewing the system boundaries. The staff concluded that the \napplicant's scoping and screening process was successful \nin identifying those system structures \nand components needing to be given an aging management review and its documentation was \na very good quality. The applicant did not use the method used by Peach Bottom \nin which \ncomponents were brought into scope by realigning the systems at the boundaries. \nThe next inspection is the aging management program inspection \nin which the objective is to \ncon'firm that the existing aging management programs are working well and to examine the \napplicant's plans for establishing new aging management programs and enhancing existing \naging management programs. \nIn this inspection, the staff assessed existing aging management \nprograms. \nThe inspectors walk down systems with the system engineers to assess how the systems are \nbeing maintained today to give the NRC confidence that the utility will do good \nin the future. \nThere were no major problems identified during the aging management program inspection. \nThe inspectors did identify that the electrical cable manholes periodic inspection program \nneeded enhancements. The applicant agreed to that and has since enhanced that program. \nMr. Rosen expressed concern that all nuclear plants have manholes \nin the yards that can collect \nwater, yet this issues comes up consistently \nin LRA reviews. This is a real problem. Ms. \nFranovich responded that the GALL report contains \nan A&P that addresses cables exposed to \nmoisture and significant moisture that is  1O-year test and acknowledged that an ISG should be \nwritten on this matter. \nMr. Jeng, briefly discussed the \nstaffs review of below-grade concrete aging management. The \nstaff position for below grade concrete \nis that if it  is  not exposed to the environment then there \nwill be no need for inspection \nof those concrete elements. However, if the environment is \nestablished to be an aggressive one, then the staff requires an applicant to propose an \nappropriate aging management program. \nThe criteria to determine whether an environment is  aggressive consists \nof three points in the \nGALL and is not quite quantitative. The first point is  that the \npH of the environment should not \nbe less than 5.5; the second point is  that the chloride content \nof the ground water in the soil \nenvironment should not be larger than 500 PPM; and the third point are the solvent content \nrequirements, which the staff maintains they should not exceed 1500 PPM. \nIn the case of the St. Lucie, the site is  quite unique in having an aggressive environment. \nSpecifically, the content of the chloride \nin the St. Lucie site ground water is in the order of 10,000 \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 17 \nApril 9, 2003 \nto 25,000 PPM (salt water is approximately 22,000 PPM) compared to the acceptable limit of \n500 PPM. \nIn terms of the sulfate content of the St. Lucie ground water, it's in the order of 1,000 to 4,000 \nPPM, which exceeds the staff's limit \nof 1500 PPM. Therefore, the applicant took the initiative to \ntreat the environment as a very aggressive one with regard to its aging management program. \nThe staff finds this acceptable. \nWith regard to the applicant's management \nof rebar corrosion in concrete corrosion and how it \nhas evaluated the affects of phosphate on the aging of concrete, the staff finds the applicant's \nconclusions (as stated previously \nin this Subcommittee Meeting) very reasonable and adequate \nDr. Ford expressed concern with the methods used by the applicant to monitor for sea water \nattack on concrete and rebar. Mr. Rosen added that, periodically looking for interior leakage is  a \ngood thing, but it  is  after the fact. Looking at exterior structures whenever they are excavated is \ngood thing but it is  random. Given the importance of the integrity \nof structures exposed to \naggressive ground water environments more should be done to verify the integrity \nof the \nconcrete and rebar. Dr. Kuo agreed and noted that this his is  a generic problem and not St. \nLucie specific. \nTIME-LIMITED AGING ANALYSES Mr. Noel Dudley \nMr. Dudley noted that TLAA's have evolved since issuance of the original plant operating \nlicense. For example, analyses supporting core barrel repair \nor the reactor coolant system half­\nnozzle repairs. The staff's review \nof TLAA's confirms that the applicant has evaluated the \nTLAA's by verifying either the analysis is  valid for a period of extended operation, \nor the analysis \nis  projected to the end of the period \nof extended operations and the results continue to meet the \ndesign requirements, or there's a program to manage the aging effects. \nReactor neutron ernbrittlement consists \nof three separate analyses: the end of life Upper Shelf \nEnergy; the pressurized thermal shock reference temperature; and the pressure and \ntemperature limits as a discussion item since it's not truly a TLAA. \nThe analysis \nof the upper shelf energies for the different reactor vessel belt line materials was \nprojected to the end \nof a period of extended operations. The results of the applicant's calculated \nupper shelf energies for Unit 1 reactor vessel ranged from 56 to 73 foot pounds, which are \nabove the acceptance criterion \nof 50-foot pounds. The results for Unit 2 range from 70 to 130­\nfoot pounds, which again is  above the criterion. The staff performed independent calculations to \nconfirm these results \nin accordance with the guidance in Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.99, \n\"Radiation Embrittlement of Reactor Vessel Materials\". Mr. Medoff added that to perform the \nindependent calculations, the staff has a reactor vessel integrity database that includes all the \nbelt line materials for all the U.S. plants, including St. Lucie 1 and \n2. For the neutron \nembrittlement assessments for pressurized thermal shock and Upper Shelf, the staff performed \nindependent calculations of all the materials, and the methods \nin the database follow the \nguidelines \nof regulatory guide 1.99, Revision 2, which has been in use for a long time. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 18 \nApril 9. 2003 \nMr. Leitch questioned whether the applicant had committed to implement forthcoming guidance \nprovided by NRC regarding the resolution of Generic Safety Issue (GSI) 168. \nDr. Kuo \nresponded that the applicant has committed to some of the programs \nin GALL Chapter 10, \neither \nE1 or E2 or E3, depending on the cables, but that the resolution of GSI 168 is  a current \noperation issue. Mr. Hale added that FP&L performed an assessment with regard to adverse \nlocalized environments that is  documented \nin summary in the LRA. \nDr. Kuo added that it would have to get back to the Committee regarding the process by which \nlicensees implement the requirements \nof GSls once they have been resolved. This includes \nthat, if new requirements are established, how does the licensee implement them \nin the \nextended license. \nThat completed the \nstaffs presentation regarding its SER. \nINTERIM STAFF GUIDANCE Mr. Jack Cushing \nJack Cushing a project manager \nin the License Renewal Branch, NRR, stated that his \npresentation would focus on the ISG process and how the staff develops ISGs, not on the \ntechnical aspects of any specific ISG. \nInterim Staff Guidance is  new \nor expanded guidance that the staff requires to communicate in a \ntimely manner to current and future applicants, as well as other stakeholders. ISGs provide \nguidance that will be incorporated into the license renewal guidance documents to state an \napproved method, but not the only method, of meeting the regulations. An applicant does not \nhave to follow the guidance, but they do have to demonstrate to the staff that their alternative \nmethod complies with the regulations. \nThe license renewal process is  a learning process. The staff and the industry learn from each \nreview. The staff captures lessons learned from the reviews and communicates them to the \nstakeholders through an ISG. The ISG also provides the stakeholders a means to raise issues \nrelated to the license renewal guidance documents \nThe ISG process includes identification, development, and implementation. Implementation of \nthe ISG includes current and future applicant and addresses evaluating licensees that hold \nrenewed licenses. Compliant ISGs involve compliance with the regulation, the staff will track the \nlicensees to which it  applies and ensure that they're evaluated \nin accordance with existing staff \nguidance prior to entering the period of extended operation. Clarification ISG's do not involve \ncompliance with the regulation, therefore, do not involve back-fit consideration. \nA proposed ISG is issued for stakeholder comments. If the stakeholders agree, then the ISG \nwill be published on the NRC web sites, and applicants may reference it in their license renewal \napplications. \nIf the stakeholders do not agree, then they may provide written comments, and the \nstaff will hold a public meeting to address these comments. At that point, the staff would resolve \nthe ISG and publish it on the NRC web site. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 19 \nApril 9, 2003 \nImplementation for applicants, current and future applicants must address all approved ISG's \nbefore a renewed license is  issued. Applicants may wish to address \nan ISG before it is \napproved so it does not have to be addressed in as a back-fit. \nCurrently, there are 14 ISG's (see attachment). The first five have been completed, and are \non \nthe NRC's web site, and current applicants are addressing them. Two are no longer ISG's \nbecause they do not involve technical information. These are ISG-8 and ISG-10. ISG-8 is the \nISG process, which we are discussing today; and ISG-10 is the standard license renewal format, \nwhich provides guidance to the applicants for the license renewal applications based on lessons \nlearned from reviews \nof applications using the new GALL format. \nThat completed the staff's formal presentations \nSUBCOMMITTEE MEMBER SlIMMARYS AND CONCLUSIONS \nMr. Rosen: \n•  Expressed concern that 10 CFR Part 54 does not require LRA to be prepared in \naccordance with a  10 CFR Part 50, Appendix \nB, Quality Assurance Program \n•  Believes that an AMP should be established for the periodic inspection \nof cables \ncontained in  manholes. \n•  Not convinced that monitoring for interior leakage,  and performing opportunistic \ninspections when areas are excavated for other work, are sufficient to monitor for the \naffects on concrete structures \nof aggressive ground water. \nMr. Leitch: \n•  Would like to hear more about TLAAs for reactor vessel core barrels at the September \nACRS Full Committee Meeting. \n•  Would like to hear the applicant's follow-on process to track and implement license \nrenewal commitments (similar to what the Peach Bottom applicant presented during the \nMarch 2003 ACRS Full Committee Meeting). The applicants commitments for the \nresolution \nof GSI-168, should be discussed during time. \nDr. Ford: \n•  No comments specific to the St. Lucie LRA. \n•  The GALL needs to be updated to include the synergistic effects \nof AMPs \n•  Inspection intervals need to be quantified. Currently, licensees are relying on \nengineering judgement. A decision process needs to be established. \n•  At the full Committee Meeting the applicant should discuss in more detail its program for \nconcrete inspections. \nMr. Bonaca: \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 20 \nApril 9, 2003 \n•  At the full Committee Meeting the applicant should discuss in more detail the \nindependent assessment it had performed \non the affects of phosphates on concrete \nperformance. \n•  At the full Committee Meeting the applicant should not spend much time \non process and \nscoping. The applicant's presentation should focus on future activities associated with \nlicense renewal. \n•  At the full Committee Meeting the staff should discuss the ISG process and status. \nSTAFF AND INDUSTRY COMMITMENTS \n1.  The staff committed to meet with the staff regarding the quality assurance used to \ndevelop \nof LRAs. \n2.  The staff should be prepared to discuss the periodic inspection of electrical cables in \nmanholes. \n3.  The staff committed to brief the Committee regarding the process by which licensees \nimplement the requirements \nof GSls once they have been resolved. \n4.  At the September 2003 full Committee Meeting the applicant and staff will discus the \nfollowing: \n•  the TLAAs for reactor vessel core barrels \nin more detail, \n•  the follow-on process for tracking, implementing, and tracking commitments, \nincluding a follow-up of the applicant's commitments to GSI-168. \n•  concrete inspection programs \nin more detail including the independent \nassessment the applicant had performed on the affects of phosphates \non \nconcrete performance, \n•  the inspection \nof buried concrete structures. \n•  the applicant should not spend much time on process and scoping. The \napplicant's presentation should focus on future activities associated with license \nrenewal. \n•  the staff should discuss the ISG process and status. \n•  any relevant significant operational events \nSUBCOMMITTEE DECISION \nThe Subcommittee decided not to prepare an interim letter regarding this LRA. The \nSubcommittee Chairman briefed the full Committee on the \nSt. Lucie LRA at the April 2003 \nACRS Meeting. The Subcommittee requested that the staff present \nan abbreviated-version of its \npresentation regarding the SER, and the applicant discuss its programs to track and implement \ncommitments made for license renewal, to the ACRS one month after it  submits the final SER to \nthe Committee for review. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 21 \nApril 9, 2003 \nPRESENTATION SLIDES AND HANDOUTS PROVIDED DURING THE MEETING \nThe presentation slides and handouts used during the meeting are available in the ACRS office \nfiles and as attachments to the transcript which will be made available \nin ADAMS. \nBACKGROUND MATERIAL PROVIDED TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE \n1.  \"Safety Evaluation Report with Open Items Related to the License Renewal of St. Lucie \nUnits 1 and 2,\" February 2003 (CD-ROM also included). \n2.

The presentation to the Subcommittee \nis summarized below. \nOpening Remarks \nMr. Bonaca, Chairman of the Plant License Renewal Subcommittee, convened the meeting and \nmade a few introductory remarks. The purpose \nof this meeting is to review Entergy's license \nrenewal application (LRA) and the related Draft Safety Evaluation Report (SER) for Arkansas \nNuclear One, Unit 2 \n(AN02). Mr. Bonaca called upon Mr. Kuo of the Office of Nuclear Reactor \nRegulation (NRR) to begin the discussion. \nStaff Introduction \nMr. Kuo introduced several members of the staff including Mr. Suber (license renewal program \nmanager), Ms. Nease (inspection team leader), and Mr. Cranston (audit team leader). Mr. Kuo also \nnoted that \nAN02 is  the second plant to be reviewed with a new process that uses on-site audits \nto verify consistency with the Generic Aging Lessons Learned Report (GALL). \nAN02 License Renewal Application \nMr. Young, Entergy, greeted the Subcommittee and introduced accompanying members of the \nEntergy and AREVA staff. The key elements \nof Mr. Young's presentation included a \ndescription \nof AN02, its operating history, the scoping methodology, the application of GALL, \nand commitment tracking. \nBackground and Plant Description \nOn October 15, 2003, Entergy submitted \nan application to the NRC for renewal of the AN02 \noperating license for an additional 20 years. The current operating license for AN02 expires on \nJuly 17, 2018. Entergy also identified staff approved past precedents that are not in GALL and \nprovided this information to the staff. \n2\n \n\nAN02 is a pressurized water reactor (PWR) unit with a dry ambient containment. AN02 began\n \ninitial operations \nin 1978 and has a capacity of 3026 MWt or 1023 MWe. Mr. Young also noted\n \nsome differences between \nANa Unit 1 and 2. Unit 1 is a Babcock and Wilcox PWR that uses\n \nonce through cooling, while Unit 2 is  a Combustion Engineering PWR with a cooling tower.\n \nOperating Historv/Major Equipment Replacements and Repairs\n \nIn 2002, a power uprate of 7.5% increased capacity by 210 MWe. In 2000 the steam\n \ngenerators were replaced with Westinghouse Delta 109 U-tube steam generators.\n \nScoping and Screening Method\n \nThe scoping methodology was applied on a plant system basis per the requirements of 10 CFR\n \n54.4(a) and screening was performed per the requirements \nof 10 CFR 54.21 (a)1. Mr. Young\n \nadded that \nall components located in a room that contains both safety and non-safety related\n \nequipment were assumed to be \nin scope.\n \nApplication \nof GALL\n \nThe \nAN02 license renewal application focused on consistency with GALL but since some\n \nmaterial/environment/program combinations were not addressed \nin GALL some plant-specific\n \nprograms were used. \nMr. Young stated that information from Entergy's past precedent review\n \nwas provided separately from the LRA. This information is  being considered by the staff \nin an\n \nupdate of the GALL report.\n \nOf the 33 aging management programs (AMPs) at AN02, 15 are consistent with GALL with\n \nenhancements, 7 are consistent with GALL with exceptions, and \n11 are plant-specific. Of the\n \n11 plant-specific programs, 8 are based on past precedents. Mr. Young stated that the One­\n\nTime Inspection Program was added after the LRA was submitted.\n \nCommitment Tracking\n \nMr. Young stated that all commitments made through the LRA, the audit/inspection process,\n \nand requests for additional information are tracked with the ANO Licensing Commitment\n \nTracking System.\n \nMr. Young concluded by stating that the use of past precedents and the on-site audits increase\n \nthe efficiency of the license renewal process.\n \nSER Overview \nMr. Suber discussed the staff's license renewal activities. The key elements of the staff's \npresentation described \nan overview of the Draft SER, the aging management program reviews \nand audits, and the time-limited aging analyses. \nThe Draft SER did not contain any open or confirmatory items but did list the following license \nconditions: \n1.  The FSAR should be updated upon issuance of the renewed license. \n2.  The future activities should be completed as described in the FSAR Supplement prior to \nentering the period \nof extended operation. \n3\n \n\n3.  The reactor vessel surveillance capsules should be removed and tested in accordance \nwith ASTM E185-82 and any changes \nto the withdrawal schedule or storage \nrequirements should be approved by the NRC. \nMr. Suber listed the dates of the various audits and inspections performed by the staff. \nScoping and Screening \nMr. Suber stated that the scoping and screening methodology is  adequately described in the \nLRA and satisfies the requirements \nin 10 CFR 54.4 and 10 CFR 54.21 (a)(1). In addition, the \nreview of the scoping and screening results found that the systems, structures, and \ncomponents (SSCs) within scope of license renewal and subject to \nan aging management \nreview (AMR) have been identified. As a result of the staff's review, the feedwater outboard \nblock valve and the power transmission conductors were brought into scope, and the intake \ncanal structure was included \nin an aging management program. \nOnsite Inspection Results \nMs. Nease, Region IV, described the license renewal inspections performed by the Region. \nThese inspections were performed \nin accordance with License Renewal Manual Chapter \nMC2516, Inspection Procedure IP 71002, and a site-specific inspection plan. The scoping and \nscreening inspection was performed \nin March 2004 and concluded that the scoping and \nscreening process successfully identified those SSCs requiring \nan AMR. As a result of this \ninspection the spent fuel pool cooling pumps and the switchyard control house were brought \ninto scope of license renewal. The aging management review inspection was performed \nin \nNovember 2004 to confirm that the applicant has or will implement AMPs to manage the effects \nof aging. The results of this inspection will be documented \nin a future inspection report. \nMs. Nease also described the recent performance of AN02. All of the NRC performance \nindicators for the third quarter of 2004 are green. However, \nAN02 is in the Regulatory \nResponse Column \nof the NRC Action Matrix because of a white finding in the area of fire \nprotection. \nMs. Nease concluded by stating that the Annual Assessment Letter for AN02 \nidentified a substantive issue regarding Problem Identification and Resolution. \nAging Management Program Review and Audits \nMr. Suber described the staff's review of the aging effects associated with various plant \nsystems and components. The staff's review of the reactor vessel, internals and reactor \ncoolant systems resulted \nin 1 license condition and 3 commitments to submit AMPs for NRC \nreview and approval. As a result of the staff's review the One-Time Inspection Program was \nadded to supplement the System Walkdown AMP and the intake canal structure was included \nin the Structures Monitoring Program. Even though the pH, chloride and sulfate levels of the \nbelow grade water environment are nonaggressive, the Structures Monitoring Program will be \nused to manage the effects \nof aging of inaccessible concrete. Mr. Suber also noted that the \npower transmission conductors which were brought \nin scope as a result of the staff's review, did \nnot require \nan AMP. \nMr. Cranston, NRR, stated that AMPs are divided into 4 categories: consistent with GALL, \nconsistent with GALL with exceptions, consistent with GALL with enhancements, and based \non \npreviously approved staff positions. Mr. Cranston also noted that information regarding NRC \napproved precedents was supplementary information provided voluntarily by the applicant. It \n4\n \n\nwas not part of the LRA. For the AMPs based on past precedents, the audit team evaluated the \napplicability of the previously approved staff position, determined if the program was bounded \nby the conditions for which the previous staff position was approved, and verified that the \nprogram contains the attributes of the referenced precedent. \nMr. Cranston described several of \nthe AMPs including the Structures Monitoring - Masonry Wall Program, the Diesel Fuel \nMonitoring Program, the Fire Water System Program, and the Cast Austenitic Stainless Steel \nEvaluation Program. \nThe Structures Monitoring - Masonry Wall Program is  an existing AMP that is  consistent with \nGALL. During the audit of this AMP, the team found that the initial baseline examinations were \nnot documented properly, the first 5 year reexamination was not performed, and qualifications \nfor personnel qualified to perform walkdowns were not established. The applicant generated a \ncondition report to document and correct these deficiencies. \nThe Diesel Fuel Monitoring Program is  new AMP that is  consistent with GALL with exceptions. \nThe exceptions are the use of fewer additives, the use of ASTM standard D 1796 instead of D \n2709, the use of a smaller filter pore size, and a lack of ultrasonic measurements of tank \nbottoms. The staff found these exceptions acceptable because a vendor recommended \nadditive package was used, ASTM D2709 did not apply, the smaller pore size is  more \nconservative, the bottom of the tank is  not likely to \nbe exposed to water, accessible tank \nsurfaces undergo a periodic visual inspection, and operating experience at \nAN02 has not \nshown any wall thinning problems. \nThe Fire Water System is \nan example of an AMP that is consistent with GALL with \nenhancements. The program enhancement is  to inspect sprinkler heads consistent with Interim \nStaff Guidance (ISG) 04. \nThe Cast Austenitic Stainless Steel (CASS) Evaluation Program was originally submitted based \non a previously approved staff position but was changed to \nbe consistent with GALL. The audit \nteam determined that the code case to perform only external visual inspections was not \napplicable to \nAN02. Therefore, the applicant revised the AMP to be consistent with GALL. An \nexample of a plant-specific AMP based \non a previously approved staff position is the Wall \nThinning Monitoring Program. This AMP was previously approved by the staff for \nAN01. \nThe staff concluded that the applicant has demonstrated the effects of aging will be managed \nso that the intended functions will be maintained consistent with the current licensing basis for \nthe period of extended operation. \nTime Limited Aging Analyses (TLAAs) \nMr. Suber stated that the applicant has identified the appropriate TLAAs. Of the 11 TLAAs at \nAN02, 5 were identified from NUREG 1800 and 6 were identified by the applicant. The \napplicant has also demonstrated that (1) the TLAAs are valid for the period of extended \noperation, (2) the TLAAs are projected to the end of the period of extended operation, or (3) \nthat aging effects will be adequately managed for the period of extended operation. \nEmbrittlement of the reactor vessel affects TLAAs associated with upper shelf energy (USE), \npressurized thermal shock (PTS), and pressure temperature limits. Calculations by the staff \nand applicant demonstrate that the beltline materials continue to meet the USE acceptance \n5\n \n\ncriterion in 10 CFR 50 Appendix G through 48 Effective Full Power Years (EFPY). The staff \nalso performed independent calculations of RT\nPTS values and concluded that the limiting beltline \nmaterial continues to meet the screening criterion \nin 10 CFR 50.61 through 48 EFPY. \nThe staff concluded that analyses associated with fatigue of ASME Class 1 components; \nfatigue of ASME Non-Class 1 piping components; fatigue of containment liner plate and \npenetrations; fracture of reactor coolant pump casings, and Leak-Before-Break of RCS piping \nsystems remain valid for the period of extended operation. \nThe staff made the following conclusions regarding the other TLAAs: \n1.  The loss of prestress in containment tendons will be adequately managed for the \nextended period of operation. \n2.  The Environmental Qualification Program is consistent with GALL and will continue to \nmanage equipment \nin accordance with 10 CFR 50.49. \n3.  The analyses of Alloy 600 nozzle repairs projected through the period of extended \noperation are valid. \nMr. Suber concluded by stating that the applicant has met the requirements for license renewal \nand there is reasonable assurance that activities will continue to be conducted \nin the renewal \nterm \nin accordance with the current licensing basis. \nMember Comments \nGeneral \nChairman Bonaca and Member Rosen asked about the replacement steam generators. \nMr. \nYoung replied that the replacement steam generators were of the same design as the original \nsteam generators but were designed for a higher power rating and contained tube materials \nconstructed from Alloy 690. \nSeveral Members and Consultant Leitch asked questions regarding the reactor pressure vessel \nhead. The applicant stated that \nan inspection of the head in 2002 did not indicate any leakage \neven though \nAN02 is  a high susceptibility plant. Since some of the penetrations are covered \nby a shroud which prevents a complete 360\n0 \nbare metal visual inspection, alternative eddy \ncurrent and ultrasonic inspections were performed. The results \nof these volumetric inspections \ndid not show any cracking. The applicant has plans to replace the head, but the earliest this \ncould \nbe done is  2008. In the meantime the applicant plans to modify the shroud covering the \npenetrations to allow increased access for visual inspections. \nIn response to a question from Consultant Leitch, Ms. Nease stated that the material condition \nof the plant was very good. \nChairman Bonaca and Member Rosen asked about the issue identified \nin the Annual \nAssessment Letter regarding Problem Identification and Resolution. Ms. Nease responded that \nerrors \nin the prioritization, implementation, and effectiveness of corrective actions were found \nacross the board at the plant. This is  a concern because AMPs depend upon the effectiveness \nof the Corrective Action Program. \n6\n \n\nChairman Bonaca and Member Wallis commented that the audit report for AMPs and AMRs is \nvery valuable to reviewers. \nSeveral Members commented that there are \nno issues regarding the AN02 license renewal \napplication or draft SER. \nScoping and Screening \nSeveral Members and Consultant Leitch asked questions regarding the justification for the \nscoping and screening classification of components. \nIn response to a question from Consultant Leitch, the applicant stated that there were no \nproblems associated with the scoping of systems shared between Units 1 and \n2. \nConsultant Leitch asked if the scoping process considers situations in which the disintegration \nof non safety-related components affects the operation of safety-related components. Except \nfor steam dryers \nin BWRs, operating experience has shown that this type of interaction has not \nbeen a problem. The staff added that active components are examined routinely as part of the \nmaintenance program. \nAging Management \nConsultant Leitch asked why buried components are inspected opportunistically and not at a \nscheduled frequency as recommended by GALL. \nMr. Young replied that operating experience \nhas shown that underground pipes are excavated every 5 to \n10 years and inspected at that \ntime. \nMr. Young added that excavating a pipe has the potential to damage its external coating. \nIn response to a question from Member Sieber, the applicant stated that no inspections are \nperformed \non the inside of buried pipes because other AMPs are credited for managing \ncorrosion \non these interior surfaces. \nConsultant Leitch asked about the schedule for implementing new AMPs and suggested that \nthis information be discussed at the Full Committee meeting. The applicant stated that the new \nAMPs will \nbe phased in such that they will all be in place at least 2 years before the 40\nth \nyear of \noperation. A detailed implementation schedule will be developed after the renewed license has \nbeen issued. \nSeveral Members asked questions regarding the staff's review of the quality of the AMPs. The \nheadquarters staff and audit team assess the quality of the programs while the regional \ninspection team verifies that the programs are implemented as described. \nIn determining the \neffectiveness of current AMPs, the staff considers operating experience, performs walkdowns, \nand examines Condition Reports. \nMember Ford asked about the inspection program for reactor vessel internals. The staff \nresponded that the reactor vessel internals programs have not been finalized but the applicant \nhas committed to submitting these programs for staff review 2 years before entering the period \nof extended operation. \nMember Ford asked if corrosion \nof carbon steel pipes could clog up the nozzles in the fire \nprotection systems. The applicant responded that if this clogging occurred, it would be \nidentified during the periodic flushing performed as part of the AMP for the fire protection \nsystems. \n7\n \n\nMembers Ford and Rosen asked about the aging management of inaccessible concrete. The \nmost recent tests \nof groundwater chemistry indicate that the below grade environment is  not \naggressive. Since well water is  no longer available for periodic monitoring, the applicant chose \nto use the Structures Monitoring Program to manage the effects \nof aging. Under this program \nconcrete exposed to lakewater will \nbe periodically inspected. Since the chemistry of lakewater \nand ground water are similar, these inspection results will \nbe representative of underground \nconcrete exposed to groundwater. \nMember Rosen asked if the root cause of the discrepancies \nin the Structures Monitoring ­\nMasonry Wall Program was identified. The applicant stated that some \nof these discrepancies \nwere simply the result \nof the wrong date used in determining the time for the next inspection. \nTLAAs \nThe TLAAs for reactor vessel embrittlement assumed a constant capacity factor of 80% for 60 \nyears resulting \nin 48 EFPY. Consultant Leitch and Member Rosen questioned the basis for this \nassumption and asked if the USE and PTS requirements could still be met at \n54 EFPY. The \napplicant stated that the basis for this assumption was that the LRA for \nAN01 assumed 48 \nEFPY and that operating experience to date has shown \nan 80% capacity factor for AN02. The \nstaff stated that at 54 EFPY the RT\nPTS value for the limiting beltline material increases by only 2 \ndegrees and would continue to meet the PTS screening criterion. The staff added that the \nReactor Vessel Integrity Program will ensure that fluence values are updated as needed. \nSeveral Members and Consultant Leitch asked why cumulative usage factors greater than 1 are \nacceptable for some components. The staff stated that these analyses are conservative and \nthe actual number of cycles are much lower than those used \nin these analyses. The staff \nadded that if the usage factor of a component exceeds \n1, the licensee would have to repair the \ncomponent, replace the component, refine the analysis, or implement an aging management \nprogram. The applicant added that fatigue calculations are updated every fuel cycle to verify \nthat cumulative usage factors won't exceed 1 during the next cycle. \nMember Wallis asked what data was used to analyze the loss of prestress \nin concrete \ncontainment tendons. The applicant stated that data from the containment of AN01 was \nextrapolated to 60 years and is  above the minimum requirements. \nStaff Commitments \nThe staff will calculate the USE of the limiting beltline material at 54 EFPY and report the \nresults to the Committee. \nSubcommittee Decisions and Follow-up Actions \nThe Subcommittee will summarize the discussions to the full Committee during the December \n2004 ACRS meeting. \nBackground Materials Provided to the Committee \n1.

This is the first release of \nthe 2004 FAIR Act inventories. \nInterested parties who disagree with the \nagency's initial judgment can challenge \nthe inclusion or the omission of an \nactivity on the list of activities that are \nnot inherently governmental within 30 \nworking days and, if not satisfied with \nthis review, may demand a higher \nagency review/appeal. \nThe Office of Federal Procurement \nPolicy has made available a FAIR Act \nUser's Guide through its Internet site: \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/ \nprocurementlfair-index.html. \nThis \nUser's Guide will help interested parties \nreview 2004 FAIR Act inventories, and \ngain access to agency inventories \nthrough agency Web site addresses. \nJoshua B.

The presentation to the Subcommittee \nis summarized below. \nOpening Remarks \nMr. Bonaca, Chairman of the Plant License Renewal Subcommittee, convened the meeting and \nmade a few introductory remarks. The purpose of this meeting is to review the Indiana \nMichigan Power Company's (I&M) license renewal application (LRA) and the related Safety \nEvaluation Report (SER) with Open Items for the Donald \nC. Cook Nuclear Plant (CNP) Units 1 \nand 2. Mr. Bonaca called upon Mr. Kuo of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) to \nbegin the discussion. \nStaff Introduction \nMr. Kuo introduced several members of the staff including Mr. Rowley (Project Manager), Ms. \nLougheed (Inspection Team Leader), and Mr. Cranston (Audit Team Leader). \nCNP License Renewal Application \nMr. Grumbir, I&M, greeted the Subcommittee and introduced accompanying members of the \nI&M staff. Mr. Grumbir's presentation described CNP's recent operating \nexperience, plant \nimprovements, plant-specific aging management programs (AMPs), and implementation plans. \nBackground \nIn a letter dated October 31,2003, I&M submitted an application to the NRC for renewal of CNP \noperating licenses for an additional 20 years. The current licenses for Units 1 and 2 expire on \nOctober \n25,2014, and December 23,2017, respectively. This is the third plant to be reviewed \nusing the new on-site audit process to verify consistency with the Generic Aging Lessons \nLearned (GALL) report. CNP made extensive use of past precedents \nin the LRA. \nPlant Description \nCNP consists of a two, 4-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor units with ice condenser \ncontainments. Unit 1 is licensed for a power output of 3304 MWt, and Unit 2 is  licensed for a \npower output of 3468 MWt. The approximate net electrical outputs of Unit 1 and 2 are 1044 \nMWe and 1117 MWe, respectively. CNP has 4 emergency diesel generators, operates on \nan \n18 month fuel cycle, and uses Lake Michigan as the ultimate heat sink. \n2 \n\nRecent Operating Experience \nSome of the recent events at CNP include a design basis recovery effort (September 1997 ­\nDecember 2000), silt intrusion into the essential service water system (August 2001), and fish \nintrusion (April 2003). Since their last outages, Unit 1 has been operating for 309 days and Unit \n2 has been operating for 73 days. The combined capacity factor for both units \nin 2004 is 92%. \nMr. Grumbir stated that the Reactor Oversight Process (ROP) has shown improvement \nin \nCNP's performance from 2002 to 2005. In the third quarter of 2002, Unit 1 was in the \nRegulatory Response Column and Unit 2 was \nin the Degraded Cornerstone Column of the ROP \nAction Matrix. \nIn 2005 Unit 1 entered the Licensee Response Column and Unit 2 entered the \nRegulatory Response column of the Action Matrix. \nPlant Improvements \nMr. Grumbir stated that a Nuclear Asset Management plan has been developed through 2037. \nThe steam generators for Units 1 and 2 were replaced \nin 2000 and 1988, respectively. In 2002 \nand 2003 Appendix K Measurement Uncertainty Recapture power uprates were obtained for \nboth units and the reserve auxiliary transformers were replaced. In 2005 CNP will install \ntraveling water screens, convert to improved technical specifications, and  add supplemental \ndiesel generators. \nIn 2006, the Unit 1 turbine rotor will be replaced and a new computerized \nsystem (INDUS Passport) will be implemented for corrective action processes, work \nmanagement, and commitment management. The reactor heads will be replaced \nin 2006 and \n2007. Plant improvements that are currently under evaluation include dry cask storage, stretch \npower uprates, upgrades to moisture separators, replacement of the Unit 2 main transformer, \nand rewinds of the main generator. \nIndustrv Issues \nInspections of the reactor vessel heads and bottom-mounted instrumentation nozzles were \nperformed at CNP due to current industry issues. \nIn 2003 a bare metal visual inspection of the \nreactor head of Unit 1 did not show any leaks or boron deposits. Penetration weld repairs were \nperformed on the reactor head of Unit 2 \nin 2004. In  2003 the bottom-mounted instrumentation \nnozzles were inspected and no indications were found. A Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) \noperating experience evaluation was performed and showed that historical inspection results \nwere acceptable and the prediction model was working properly. \nScoping and Screening Method \nMr. Kalinowski, I&M, stated that the scoping and screening methodology applied at CNP \nis \nconsistent with previous applications. Under the \"spaces\" approach used by CNP, all \ncomponents \nin an area of the plant that contained safety-related components were considered \nto \nbe in scope. \nAging Management Programs \nMr. Kalinowski stated that the Aging Management Reviews (AMRs) were structured to align \nwith GALL and the determination of consistency with GALL was applied conservatively. Prior to \nthe Aging Management Program audit, information was provided regarding past precedents. \nOf the 46 AMPs at CNP, 16 are plant-specific. Mr. Kalinowski briefly described some of the \nplant specific programs such as Boral Surveillance, lSI Augmented Inspection, Instrument Air \nQuality, and Structures Monitoring. \n3 \n\nCommitment Tracking \nMr. Grumbir stated that commitments documented \nin the LRA are tracked by CNP's \ncommitment management system and adjusted \nas needed. I&M has committed to \nimplementing enhancements to the programs prior to entering the period of extended operation \nbut a more aggressive internal schedule has been established. Draft procedure changes are \nbeing developed and should be implemented by 2005. Mr. Grumbir noted that many of these \nenhancements are already being performed but are just not proceduralized. Long-range \nactivities will be tracked by CNP's Action Tracking Program. The project plan includes the \nturnover of responsibilities to line departments. \nMr. Grumbir concluded his presentation by stating that the staff has performed a thorough \nreview and American Electric Power is  committed to the safe, long-term operation of CNP. \nSER Overview \nMr. Rowley led the staff's presentation of the SER with Open Items, the scoping and screening \nreview, the AMP reviews and audits, and the time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs). \nThe SER with Open Items was issued on December \n21 , 2004, containing two open items and \ntwo confirmatory items. Since that time resolution has been reached on all of these items. As \na result of the staff's review 5 components/commodities were brought into scope and subjected \nto an aging management review. \nMr. Rowley listed the dates of the audits and inspections performed by the staff. \nScoping and Screening \nMr. Rowley stated that the scoping and screening methodology is adequately described \nin the \nLRA and satisfies the requirements \nin 10 CFR 54.4 and 10 CFR 54.21 (a)(1). The staff \nreviewed the scoping and screening results to determine if  all structures were properly \nidentified. As a result of the staff's review, insulation for pipe and penetrations, emergency \ndiesel generator (EDG) exhaust silencers, auxiliary feedwater suction strainers, the EDG Air \ndistributor housings, and the spent fuel pool makeup supply refueling water storage tank were \nbrought into scope. The staff determined that the systems, structures, and components (SSCs) \nwithin scope of license renewal and subject to an AMR have been identified. \nOnsite Inspection Results \nMs. Lougheed, Region III, described the license renewal inspections performed by the staff. \nThe objective of the scoping and screening inspection is to confirm that the applicant has \nincluded all SSCs within the scope of license renewal as required by the rule. During this \ninspection 3 issues were identified regarding partially buried piping, emergency core cooling \nsystem piping leak detection enclosures, and main steam system stop valves. This inspection \nconcluded that the scoping and screening activities successfully identified those SSCs requiring \nan AMR. \nThe objective of the AMP inspection is to confirm that the applicant has implemented or plans to \nimplement programs to manage the effects of aging. During this inspection the 3 issues \nidentified during the scoping and screening inspection were resolved. No issues were identified \nthat would be an adverse indicator for license renewal, but two issues were raised regarding the \nFAC Program and the Boral Surveillance Program that required additional review from NRR. \n4\n \n\nMs. Lougheed described the recent performance of CNP. The licensee is in the Regulatory \nResponse Column of the NRC Action Matrix because both units have a white inspection finding \nin the Public Radiation Safety cornerstone and Unit 2 has a white performance indicator in the \nInitiating Events cornerstone. No substantive cross-cutting issues have been identified. The \nstaff is conducting an internal end-of-cycle screening meeting and will provide the results to \nlicensee and public within the next several weeks. Ms. Lougheed concluded by stating that \ncurrent performance does not show any indicators that would preclude license renewal. \nAging Management Program Review and Audits \nThere are 46 aging management programs at CNP. 33 of these are existing programs and 13 \nare new programs. These AMPs can also be categorized by their consistency with GALL. 13 \nAMPs are consistent with GALL, 17 AMPs are consistent with exceptions and/or \nenhancements, and 16 AMPs are plant-specific. \nThe staff reviewed 34 AMPs using the audit process. Mr. Cranston described some of these \nAMPs such as the Service Water System Reliability Program, the Cast Austenitic Stainless \nSteel (CASS) Program, the System Walkdown Program, and the FAC Program. \nThe Service Water System Reliability Program is consistent with GALL with exceptions and \nenhancements. The exception is that heat exchangers will be visually inspected and cleaned \nbut will not undergo thermal performance testing. The staff's basis for approving this exception \nis that inspection and cleaning is consistent with the applicant's approved submittal to GL 89-13 \nand any adverse inspection findings will result \nin a test of the heat exchanger. In order to be \nconsistent with GALL, a physical check for selective leaching will \nbe performed during visual \ninspections. \nThe CASS program originally cited a previously approved staff position to perform only external, \nvisual inspections based on an approved code case. The audit team determined that this code \ncase was not applicable to the plant. This AMP was revised to be consistent with GALL so \nvolumetric inspections or flaw tolerance evaluations will be performed. \nThe System Walkdown Program was credited for managing loss of material \non both the internal \nan external surfaces of carbon steel materials. The staff requested more information regarding \nthE? basis for this program to detect loss of material on internal surfaces. The applicant made a \nrevision that credits a combination of other AMPs (FAC, Service Water System Reliability, and \nOne-Time Inspection) with the management of internal aging effects for these components. \nThe staff identified 2 issues during the review of the FAC program. The staff found that this \nprogram was not credited for detecting aging effects \nin main steam nozzles so this AMP was \nrevised to include these components. The staff also found that the basis for expansion testing \nin this AMP was not consistent with GALL. In GALL the criteria for sample expansion is \nmeasured wall thinning greater than predicted. The criteria \nin the LRA was a measured wall \nthickness less than a threshold value. Therefore, the AMP was revised to be consistent with \nGALL with an exception regarding the use of a threshold criteria for sample expansion. \nMr. Rowley described 2 AMPs that were not reviewed using the audit process. The Reactor \nVessel Internals Plates, Forgings, Welds, and Bolting Program was not audited because of \n5\n \n\nemerging issues associated with stress corrosion cracking, irradiation assisted stress corrosion \ncracking, and void swelling. The Steam Generator Integrity Program was not audited because \nthe replacement steam generator are constructed from Alloy 690 and GALL deals with Alloy \n600. \nOne of the issues identified during the AMP inspection that required additional NRR review \ndealt with the Boral Surveillance Program. Inspectors found a potential discrepancy in the \ntrending of results from Boral coupons. The staff issued a  Request for Additional Information \n(RAI) to clarify the capability to measure and evaluate these coupons. The applicant provided \ninformation regarding coupon evaluations, the results of completed evaluations, and the \nschedule for future evaluations. The staff found the response acceptable and closed the issue. \nThe staff's review of the AMR results for the reactor vessel, internals, and reactor coolant \nsystems; engineered safety features systems; steam and power conversion systems; structures \nand component supports; and electrical and instrumentation and controls did not identify any \nopen or confirmatory items. One open item was identified by the staff during the review of the \nAMR results for auxiliary systems. The staff was concerned that the visual inspections \nperformed as part of the System Walkdown Program could not effectively manage the effects \nof aging on internal surfaces of components. As a result of the staff's review, a combination of \n3 other AMPs will be used to manage the effects of aging on these internal surfaces. These 3 \nAMPs are the FAC Program, the Service Water System Reliability Program, and the One-Time \nInspection Program. The staff found this acceptable and this open item was closed. \nData taken from two sample wells at \nCI\\IP show that the below grade soil/water environment is \nnon-aggressive based on pH, chloride, and sulfate levels. \nThe staff concluded that the applicant has demonstrated the effects of aging will be managed \nsuch that intended functions will be maintained consistent with the current licensing basis for \nthe period of extended operation. \nTime Limited Aging Analyses (TLAAs) \nMr. Rowley described the staff's review of the TLAAs. \nEmbrittlement of the reactor vessel affects TLAAs associated with upper shelf energy (USE), \npressurized thermal shock (PTS), and pressure-temperature limits. Calculations by the staff \nand applicant demonstrate that the limiting beltline material for each unit exceeds the minimum \nUSE acceptance criterion \nin 10 CFR 50 Appendix G through 48 Effective Full Power Years \n(EFPY). The staff also performed independent calculations of RT\nPTS values and concluded that \nthe limiting beltline material continues to meet the screening criterion \nin 10 CFR 50.61 through \n48 EFPY. \nThe staff concluded that the cumulative usage factors (CUF) for Class 1 components will not \nexceed 1. The staff also determined that for Non-Class 1 components the fatigue analyses \nremain valid for the period of extended operation. The applicant has committed to additional \nactions for the auxiliary spray line, pressurizer surge line, residual heat removal piping, and \ncharging and safety injection nozzles. These additional actions are to either (1) perform a \nplant-specific fatigue analysis, (2) repair the affected piping, (3) replace the affected piping, or \n(4) manage the effects of fatigue by an I\\IRC-approved program. One of the confirmatory items \n6\n \n\nlisted in the draft SER was to revise the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Supplement to \ninclude these commitments. \nThe applicant's Environmental Qualification Program is  consistent with GALL and will continue \nto manage equipment \nin accordance with 10 CFR 50.49. \nA concrete containment tendon prestress TLAA is  not applicable at CNP. \nThe applicant has committed to performing additional evaluations of containment penetrations \nto satisfy the requirements of 10 CFR 54.21 \n(c)(1 )(i). The second confirmatory item listed in the \ndraft SER was to revise the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Supplement to include this \ncommitment. \nOne of the plant-specific TLAAs is  a fatigue analysis of the ice condenser lattice frame. Past \noperating experience indicates that the operational basis earthquake limit of 400 used \nin the \nanalysis will not be exceeded during the period of extended operation. Therefore, the staff \nconcluded that this analysis remains valid \nin accordance with 10 CFR 54.21 (c)(1 )(1). \nMr. Rowley stated that the applicant has identified the appropriate TLAAs and demonstrated \nthat either (1) the TLAAs are valid for the period of extended operation, (2) the TLAAs have \nbeen projected to the end of the period of extended operation, or (3) that aging effects will be \nadequately managed for the period of extended operation. \nMr. Rowley concluded by stating that the applicant has met the requirements for license \nrenewal and there is  reasonable assurance that activities will continue to be conducted \nin the \nrenewal term \nin accordance with the current licensing basis. \nMember Comments \nGeneral \nChairman Bonaca made the following general comments regarding the last 3 license renewal \napplications reviewed by the subcommittee. \n•  Many of the new AMPs are not fully developed. The audit reports describe these new \nprograms as adequate but add that a final determination will not be made until after the \nprogram details have been developed. Chairman Bonaca is  concerned that a large \nnumber of these undefined programs could impact workload and leave any ACRS letter \nunsupported. Consultant Leitch stated that a valid reason for accepting programs that \nhave not been fully developed \nis if technical work is  still occurring in that area. \nConsultant Leitch also noted that for new programs \nin which there is  no equivalent \nGALL program, there is  essentially nothing to review. Consultant Barton added that \nsome AMPs should be implemented sooner than just prior to entering the period of \nextended operation. \n•  Applicants are taking the same exceptions to GALL for AMPs associated with buried \npiping/tanks/cables and fire protection. If these exceptions are always acceptable to the \nstaff, they should be justified and placed \nin GALL. Consultant Barton noted an \ninconsistency \nin the Buried Piping Inspection Program in that some applicants will \n7 \n\nperform a one-time inspection of these components prior to extended operation while \nothers will only inspect as part of maintenance activities. \n• The audit report is  very insightful and should be better integrated into the SER. \nConsultant Leitch asked why power levels for each unit are different. The applicant stated that \nthe units use different fuel assemblies and turbine generators. The nuclear steam supply \nequipment for both units are virtually identical. \nIn response to a question from Member Sieber, the applicant stated the capacity of the \nemergency diesel generators is 3500 kW. \nThe Design Basis Recovery effort at CNP required the reconstitution of a large number of \nsafety systems. \nIn response to a question 'from Consultant Leitch, the applicant described an \nopen issue associated with the operability of 4 kV breakers. These breakers are overdutied \nand will be replaced \nin the next outage. \nIn response to a question from Member Sieber, the applicant stated that the maintenance \noutage for Unit 2 \nin November 2004 was due to leakage in a primary side pressurizer manway. \nThe gasket for this manway is not \nin scope for license renewal because it  is  a short-lived \ncomponent that is  replaced every 8 years. \nSeveral Members asked about the ice condenser. It was noted that the LRA lacked a lot of \nspecific information about the ice condenser and many of its components were not included \nin \nscope. The applicant stated that rebuilding of the ice condenser part of containment was \ncompleted as part of the Design Basis Recovery effort \nin 2000. A detailed examination of the \nice condenser components was performed for scoping and a specific AMP exists for the ice \ncondenser. The applicant described the various components \nin the ice condenser and their \nfunctions. \nConsultant Leitch asked if there are any recent inspection findings that are not green. The \napplicant described one issue associated with the transportation of contaminated material \nin \nwhich the dose rate on the exterior of the container exceeded a Department of Transportation \nlimit. Consultant Leitch and Member Rosen also asked about the status of performance \nindicators (PI). The applicant stated that there is  a white \nPI for Unit 2 for scrams with loss of \nnormal heat removal. The root cause of the problem was closing of MSIVs following a scram. \nIt was resolved by revising the EOPs to throttle back auxiliary feedwater earlier \nin the \nsequence. \nMember Sieber asked about the steam generators. The applicant stated that the Unit 2 steam \ngenerators are constructed from thermally treated Alloy 690. The number of plugged tubes for \nUnit 1 and 2 are 4 and 16, respectively. \nChairman Bonaca and Member Sieber asked about the supplemental diesel generators that will \nbe added to the plant \nin 2005. The applicant stated these diesel generators are not safety \ngrade and will provide redundancy. \nIn response to a question from Consultant Leitch, the \napplicant stated that CNP does have containment igniters but they do not have a backup power \nsupply. The applicant added that the supplemental diesels will be sized such that they can \nprovide back-up power to the igniters. \n8\n \n\n..\n \nChairman Bonaca and Member Shack asked about the reactor vessel heads at CNP. The \napplicant stated that Unit 1 has a medium susceptibility head while Unit 2 has a high \nsusceptibility head. Two penetration weld repairs were performed on the Unit 2 head because \nof indications found by dye penetrant (PT) exams. These penetrations were repaired by weld \noverlays. \nIn response to a question from Consultant Leitch, the applicant stated that the CDF for each \nunit is  4.28x1 \n0-\n5\n• \nConsultant Leitch noted that a certain crane manufacturer has reported concerns with \noverstressing \nin certain components. The staff stated that 1 crane at CNP is  affected by this \nissue and it is  currently being reviewed by the resident inspectors. \nScoping and Screening \nConsultant Leitch asked for clarification regarding the \"spaces\" approach used for the scoping \nof 10 CFR 54.4(a)(2) components \nin which all components in an area of the plant that contained \nsafety-related components were considered to be \nin scope. The applicant stated that an area is \ndefined as a room so all components \nin the same room as safety-related components are in \nscope. Consultant Barton commented that this approach led to generic grouping of \ncomponents making it difficult to determine if specific components \nin a system were adequately \ncovered \nin the AMPs. Consultant Barton added that the \"spaces\" approach led to numerous \nRAls from the staff. . \nConsultant Leitch asked how scoping can be performed without locating all of the anchor \npoints. The applicant stated it was assumed that everything from the the nonsafety-related to \nsafety-related interface out to the first major component was \nin scope. \nChairman Bonaca asked about the 5 components/commodities that were brought into scope as \na result of the staff's review. The staff stated that certain portions of insulation were credited \nwith limited heat load \nin post accident conditions so they were brought into scope during a \nreview of the methodology. The other components were simply overlooked and brought into \nscope during the review of the scoping and screening results for mechanical systems. \nConsultant Leitch asked about the function of the leak detection enclosures that surround \nemergency core cooling piping outside containment. The staff stated that they are not safety­\nrelated and serve to funnel water to a collection point. \nAging Management \nSeveral Members asked about the criteria for expanding the scope of inspection \nin the FAC \nprogram. The applicant stated that this program \nis consistent with EPRI guidance and uses an \nexpansion criterion of 60% of the wall thickness. The staff added that \nin no case will the wall \nthickness be less than the minimum wall thickness. If a discrepancy \nis found between \ninspections and predictions, all other predicted values will be revised. These revised \npredictions may lead to further expansions of the inspection scope. \nConsultants Leitch and Barton asked about an inspection finding \nin which a pipe was found to \nbe partially buried \nin the sand. The applicant stated that this pipe was located outdoors so the \nsand had accumulated around the pipe naturally. The System Walkdown Program was revised \nto look for significant changes \nin environment. \n9 \n\n·.\n \nThere was a discussion about the BoraI Surveillance Program. Consultant Barton asked for the \nbasis \nin extending the inspection interval from 2 years to 5 years. The applicant provided data \nthat demonstrates boral degradation is  not expected to be significant. The staff added that 5 \nyears \nis consistent with a vendor recommendation. Consultant Leitch noted that removal of \nboral samples have been missed \nin the past. Consultant Leitch asked why an RAI on this \nprogram was issued so late \nin the review process. The staff stated that the RAI resulted from a \ndiscrepancy found during the AMP inspection which did not occur until November 2004. \nConsultant Barton asked when the Buried Piping Inspection Program will be implemented. The \napplicant stated that a date has not yet been determined. \nThere was a discussion regarding the System Walkdown Program. Consultant Leitch \nexpressed concern about the effectiveness of these inspections for components \nin the same \nroom as the main steam system stop valves. The staff stated that external degradation \nin this \nenvironment should not be significant. These areas are accessible during normal operation but \npipes can't be inspected because they are covered with insulation. The applicant stated that \nsystem walkdowns during normal operation look for any evidence of aging such as vibration, \nsupport degradation, and dripping water. \nIn addition opportunistic inspection of these pipes \nwould be performed when insulation is  removed during outages or maintenance activities. \nConsultant Barton questioned whether these walkdowns are actually being performed quarterly \nand whether it will continue at that frequency during the period of extended operation. \nConsultant Leitch noted that there is  a history of problems and procedure noncompliance with \nthis program. The applicant stated that the engineering resources of the plant have been \nreorganized to ensure that system engineers can effectively perform these walkdowns at the \nnecessary frequency. Pis have also been established to measure their effectiveness. \nConsultant Leitch asked why hydraulic fluids are not subject to an AMP. The applicant stated \nthat hydraulic fluids are periodically sampled \nin order to determine when they should be \nreplaced. \nChairman Bonaca and Member Rosen asked about the Service Water System Reliability \nProgram. Chairman Bonaca asked how visual inspections can ensure the thermal performance \nof a heat exchanger. The staff stated that \nin addition to visual inspection, heat exchangers are \ncleaned to return them to an \"as-new\" condition. The applicant listed some of the heat \nexchangers that would be covered by this AMP. \nThe Diesel Fuel Monitoring Program takes an exception to GALL \nin that it will not monitor for \nmicrobiologically induced corrosion (MIC) because past operating experience has not shown \nthis to be a problem. Consultant Leitch stated that this was a weak argument and noted that \nother plants have experienced MIC \nin these tanks. A similar issue exists with the domestic \nwater supply system at CNP \nin which there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in \nthe future. Chairman Bonaca added that these issues are generic and apply to the current \nlicensing basis. \nConsultant Leitch noted that a number of follow-up items \nin the audit report related to \nelastomers. The staff stated that this was due to insufficient information provided by the \napplicant \nin the original application. \n10\n \n\n·, \nTLAAs \nThe reactor vessel neutron embrittlement TLAAs assumed 48 EFPY at the end \no'f license \nextension. Consultant Leitch stated that this \nis appropriate for CNP but for other plants 54 \nEFPY would be more reasonable. \nConsultant Leitch asked about the exception to the \nPT limit calculation that permitted the use of \nCode Case \nN641 rather than 10 CFR 50 Appendix G. The staff stated that this code case \nallows the use of the crack initiation fracture toughness curve instead of the crack arrest \nfracture toughness curve and has recently been incorporated into Section \nXI of the ASME \nCode. \nThe Cumulative Usage Factor (CUF) for the Pressurizer Surge line \nis shown to be 4.5 at 60 \nyears. Consultant Leitch asked if the CUF \nis currently greater than 1 and if so what corrective \nactions have been taken. The staff stated that more detailed fatigue calculations and fatigue \nmonitoring would result \nin a lower CUF. However, the staff could not justify requiring all plants \nto perform the more detailed analysis for the current licensing basis. \nIn response to a question from Consultant Barton, the staff stated that components in the \nEnvironmental Quali'fication Program that were originally qualified for 40 years will be \nrequalified for the period of extended operation. \nMember Shack noted \nin the LRA that the TLAA associated with Leak-Before-Break did not \ndiscuss stress corrosion cracking \nin dissimilar metal welds. The applicant stated that this is \ndescribed in the Alloy 600 AMP. \nTable \n4.3-1 (page 4.3-13) of the LRA shows zero loss of load transients logged as of 10/31/98 \nand zero projected at 60 years of operation. Consultant Leitch asked if these numbers were \naccurate. The applicant committed to providing that information at a later date. \nSubcommittee Discussion \nThe Consultants and Members suggested that the following topics be discussed at the Full \nCommittee meeting: \n•  A description of the ice condenser and the license renewal activities (scoping, screening, \nand aging management) associated with its components \n•  Improvements \nin the commitment tracking process \n•  The \"spaces\" methodology used \nin scoping of 10 CFR 54.4(a)(2) components \n•  The resolution of the open item associated with the FAC program \n•  The effectiveness of the System Walkdown Program \nSubcommittee Decisions and Follow-up Actions \nThe Subcommittee will summarize the discussions to the full Committee during the February \n2005 ACRS meeting. \n11 \n\n,. \n'.\n \nBackground Materials Provided to the Committee \n1.

Background \nPursuant to section 189a.(2) of the \nAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended \n(the Act), the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission (the Commission or NRC \nstaff) is publishing this regular biweekly \nnotice. \nThe Act requires the \nCommission publish notice of any \namendments issued, or proposed to be \nissued and grants the Commission the \nauthority to issue and make \nimmediately effective any amendment \nto an operating license upon a \ndetermination by the Commission \nthat \nsuch amendment involves no significant \nhazards consideration, \nnotwithstanding \nthe pendency before the Commission of \na request for a hearing from any person. \nThis biweekly notice includes all \nnotices of amendments issued, or \nproposed to be issued from December \n23, 2004, through January 5, 2005. \nThe \nlast biweekly notice was published on \nJanuary 4,2005 (70 FR 398). \nNotice of Consideration \nof Issuance of \nAmendments to Facility Operating \nLicenses, Proposed No Significant \nHazards Consideration Determination, \nand Opportunity for a Hearing \nThe Commission has made a \nproposed determination \nthat th~ \nfollowing amendment requests mvolve \nno significant hazards consideration. \nUnder the Commission's regulations in \n10 CFR 50.92, this means \nthat operation \nof \nthe facility in accordance with the \nproposed amendment would ~ot (1) \ninvolve a significant increase m the \nprobability or consequences of an \naccident previously evaluated; or (2) \ncreate the possibility of a new or \ndifferent \nkind of accident from any \naccident previously evaluated; or \n(3) \ninvolve a significant reduction in a \nmargin of safety. The basis for this \nproposed determination for \neach \namendment request is shown below. \nThe Commission is seeking public \ncomments on this proposed \ndetermination. Any comments received \nwithin 30 days after the date of \npublication of this notice will be \nconsidered \nin making any final \ndetermination. Within 60 days after \nthe \ndate of publication of this notice, the \nlicensee may file a request for a hearing \nwith respect to issuance of the \namendment to the subject facility \noperating license \nand any person whose \ninterest may be affected \nby this \nproceeding \nand who wishes to \nparticipate as a party \nin the proceedi.ng \nmust file a written request for a hearmg \nand a petition for leave to intervene. \nNormally, the Commission will not \nissue the amendment \nuntil the \nexpiration of 60 days after the date of \npublication of this notice. The \nCommission may issue the license \namendment before expiration of the 60­\nday period provided \nthat its final \ndetermination is that the \namendment \ninvolves no significant hazards \nconsideration. In addition, the \nCommission may issue \nthe amendment \nprior to the expiration of the 30-day \ncomment period should circumstances \nchange during the 30-day \ncomment \nperiod such that failure to act in a \ntimely way \nwould result, for example in \nderating or shutdown of the facility. \nShould the Commission take action \nprior to \nthe expiration of either the \ncomment period or the notice period, \nit \nwill publish in the Federal Register a \nnotice \nof issuance. Should the \nCommission make a final No Significant \nHazards Consideration Determination, \nany hearing will take place after \nissuance. \nThe Commission expects that \nthe need to take this action will occur \nvery infrequently. \nWritten comments may be submitted \nby mail to the Chief, Rules and \nDirectives Branch, Division of \nAdministrative Services, Office of \nAdministration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, WC\\shington, \nDC 20555­\n0001, and should cite the publication \ndate \nand page number of this Federal \nRegister notice. Written comments may \nalso be delivered to Room 6D22, Two \nWhite Flint North, 11545 Rockville \nPike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 \na.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. \nCopies of written comments received \nmay be examined at the Commission's \nPublic Document Room (PDR), located \nat One White \nFlint North, Public File \nArea 01F21, 11555 Rockville Pike (first \nfloor), Rockville, Maryland. \nThe filing of \nrequests for a hearing \nand petitions for \nleave to intervene is discussed below. \nWithin 60 days after \nthe date of \npublication \nof this notice, the licensee \nmay file a request for a hearing with \nrespect to issuance of the amendment to \nthe subject facility operating license and \nany \nperson whose interest may be \naffected by this proceeding \nand who \nwishes to participate as a party in the \nproceeding \nmust file a written request \nfor a hearing \nand a petition for leave to \nintervene. Requests for a hearing \nand a \npetition for leave to intervene shall be \nfiled in accordance \nwith the \nCommission's \"Rules of Practice for \nDomestic Licensing Proceedings\" in 10 \nCFR part 2. Interested persons \nshould \nconsult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.309, \nwhich is available at the Commission's \nPDR, located at \nOne White Flint North, \nPublic File Area 01F21, 11555 Rockville \nPike (first floor), Rockville, Maryland. \nPublicly available records will be \naccessible from \nthe Agencywide \nDocuments Access \nand Management \nSystem's (ADAMS) Public Electronic \nReading Room \non the Internet at the \nNRC Web site, http://www.nre.gov/ \nreading-rm/doe-eolleetionslcfrl. \nIfa \nrequest for a hearing or petition for \nleave to intervene is filed \nwithin 60 \ndays, \nthe Commission or a presiding \nofficer designated \nby the Commission or \nby the Chief Administrative Judge of the \nAtomic Safety and Licensing Board \nPanel, will \nrule on the request andlor \npetition; and the Secretary or the Chief \nAdministrative Judge of the Atomic \nSafety \nand Licensing Board will issue a \nnotice of a hearing or \nan appropriate \norder. \nAs required \nby 10 CFR 2.309, a \npetition for leave to intervene shall set \nforth \nwith particularity the interest of \nthe petitioner in the proceeding, and \nhow that interest may be affected by the \nresults of the proceeding. \nThe petition \nshould specifically explain the reasons \nwhy intervention should be permitted \n\nAdvisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards\n \nPlant License Renewal Subcommittee Meeting\n \nDonald C.

A  list of \nmeeting attendees is available in the ACRS office files. \nACRS SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION \nDr. Mario Bonaca, Chairman of the Plant License Renewal Subcommittee, convened the \nmeeting and stated that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the staff's SER, with open \nitems, related to the license renewal Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, and the associated \nWestinghouse topical reports. Dr. Bonaca noted that during the presentation, he would raise \nissues provided by Mr. John Barton, an ACRS consultant. He called upon Ms. Elizabeth \nThompson, FPL, to begin. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 2 \nSeptember \n25, 2001 \nFPL PRESENTATION Ms. Elizabeth Thompson and Mr. Stephen Hale, FPL \nMs. Thompson, presented background information concerning the preparation of the license \nrenewal application for Turkey Point Units 3 and \n4. Mr. Stephen Hale, FPL, presented the \npurpose and criteria of the scoping and screening processes. He explained the scoping \nprocess for safety-related structures and components and for non-safety related structures and \ncomponents that could affect safety-related equipment. Mr. Hale described the screening \nprocess for mechanical systems, structures, and electrical and instrumentation and control \nsystems. \nMr. Hale presented the purpose of the aging management reviews. He explained how the \naging effects, which require aging management programs, were established based on technical \nresources, operating experience reviews, and peer reviews. He summarized the requirements \nfor common aging management programs. Mr. Hale described the time limited aging analyses \n(TLAA) process and listed the seven TLAAs for Turkey Point. He concluded that: \n• The aging management programs at Turkey Point will adequately manage aging effects \nso that the intended functions of in-scope systems, structures, and components (SSCs) \nwill be maintained consistent with the current licensing basis for the period of extended \noperations. \n• All TLAAs for Turkey Point were identified, evaluated, and shown to be acceptable for \nthe extended period of operation. \nDr. Shack asked why the staff had to issue a  request for additional information concerning the \nfatigue of the pressurizer surge line given that the same issue had been adequately addressed \nduring the staff review of the license renewal application for Arkansas nuclear One, Unit \n1. Mr. \nHale explained that Turkey Point is  the first plant to apply for license renewal that was \nconstructed \nin accordance with B-31.1 design criteria and, as such, new questions were \nidentified regarding the design of the pressurizer. In addition, the safety evaluation of the \nWestinghouse topical report WCAP-14574-A, \"License Renewal Evaluation: Aging \nManagement Evaluation for Pressurizes,\" identified new areas of concerns that the applicant \naddressed. \nDr. Bonaca questioned how the application would have been modified if the generic guidance \ndocuments had been available. Mr. Hale explained that referencing the Generic Aging Lessons \nLearned (GALL) report would have been beneficial. \nMr. Rosen asked why it was necessary to consider non-safety SSCs \nin the scoping and \nscreening process. Mr. Hale stated that since Turkey Point was one of the early plants which \nwas licensed, not all systems now considered to be safety-related were identified as safety­\nrelated. \nIn response to a question prepared by Mr. Barton, Mr. Hale explained why the following SSCs \nwere not included \nin scope: \n•  Hot containment penetrations lines are outside plant structures and will not exceed \n150°F if a  line break occurs. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 3 \nSeptember \n25, 2001 \n•  The consequences of a release from the ventilation system of the Radiological Waste \nBuilding is  less than 10 CFR Part 100 limits. \n•  The screen wash system is not necessary to maintain suction during a severe accident, \nsince the circulating water pumps are secured. \n•  The C-bus only provides power to non-safety loads. \n•  The off-site transformers are not necessary during severe accidents since the safety­\nrelated diesel generators provide power. \nMr. Bonaca questioned why the spent fuel pool cooling system was within scope for Turkey \nPoint when all previous applicants considered spent fuel pool cooling systems to be outside the \nscope of license renewal. Mr. Stephen Hoffman explained that scoping of SSCs was \ndependent of the current design basis for each plant. \nThe Subcommittee members and FPL representatives discussed the aging management \nprogram for the fatigue of thin wall stainless steel piping located \nin trenches outside the turbine \nbuilding. Mr. Hale explained that the aging management program for these pipes was derived \nfrom operational experience of similar pipes at St. Lucie. \nDr. Ford questioned how licensees predict the failure of component, such as baffle bolts, and \nhow they calculated the risk associated with these failures. Mr. Hale explained that the industry \nuses operating experience and the results of inservice inspections and inservice tests to move \ntoward risk-informed inspection programs. He noted that aging management programs rely \non \ndefense-in-depth designs, operating experience, redundancy, and early defect detection to \ncontrol risk. \nDr. Bonaca asked why ASME Class \nII pipes were not within the scope of license renewal when \nthey were physically located over Class I pipes. Mr. Hale explained that failures of ASME Class \nII pipes were not part of the current design accident analyses and that non-safety related \nsystems which affect safety related components are already considered within scope \n(Le. piping \nsupports). \nNRC SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT (SER) PRESENTATION \nIntroduction: \nMr. Rajender Auluck, NRR \nMr. Rajender Auluck outlined the staff's presentation and introduced the presenters. He \nprovided an overview of the license review schedule and the SER format. Mr. Auluck \nsummarized the open items and the staff's inspection activities. During discussions with the \nSubcommittee members, Mr. Auluck provided the following information. \n•  \nIn response to the emerging issue of reactor vessel head penetration cracking, the \napplicant committed to adopt future industry recommendations. \n•  Emerging issues, which are identified after the operating license is  renewed, will be \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 4 \nSeptember 25,2001 \nhandled by using the existing site-specific corrective action program. \n•  Babcock and Wilcox manufactured the Turkey Point reactor vessel to Westinghouse \nspecifications. \n•  The Turkey Point fatigue monitoring program verifies commutative usage factors are not \nexceeded. \n•  The Turkey Point license renewal application contained most of the required \ninformation, however, the staff needed assistance \nin located specific information. \nChap. 2.0 -Structures and Components Subject to an Aging Management Review: \nMessrs. Greg Galletti and Brian Thomas, NRR \nThe staff described its methodology for reviewing the applicant's scoping and screening \nprocess, its on-site audits, and its findings and conclusions. \nMr. Rosen questioned the use of the emergency operating procedures (EOPs) \nin the scoping \nand screening processes. Mr. Galletti explained that the results of the processes were \ncompared to the maintenance program results, which were derived \nin part, by using the EOPs. \nMr. Rosen noted that the staff did not evaluate the qualification and training of licensee \npersonnel on the commitments made \nin the license renewal application. Ms. Thompson, FPL, \nstated that the new information \nin the application was automatically included in the training \nprograms for licensee engineers. \nChap. 3.1 - Common Aging Management Programs: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR \nMs. Meena Khanna, NRR, identified the common aging management programs the staff \nreviewed. \nChap. 3.2 -Reactor Coolant System: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR \nMs. Khanna identified the systems reviewed by the staff. She noted that the applicant did not \nreference the Westinghouse topical reports \nin the application, but did compare the topical report \nresults to the commitments \nin the application. She stated that the reactor vessel head \npenetration nozzle cracking will be managed by the reactor vessel head alloy \n600 penetration \ninspection program. \nDr. Bonaca questioned whether all Westinghouse topical report action items were addressed \nin \nthe application. Mr. Hale, FPL, explained that the action items not addressed in the application \nwere addressed \nin subsequent responses to staff Requests for Additional Information. \nDr. Ford asked if the reactor vessel internals aging management program had been reviewed \nagainst the ASME code. Mr. Allen Hiser, Jr., NRR, explained that the inspection programs were \nstill being developed and that the staff was monitoring the industry's progress. \nDr. Ford asked when data would become available to better predict component failures. The \nstaff explained that inspections were ongoing at established intervals and that if  research \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 5 \nSeptember \n25, 2001 \nresults indicated problems, then the inspection intervals would be shortened. Dr. Ford stated \nthat not enough data presently exists and that 10 year is  too long to wait. He suggested that \ncalculated changes \nin the loss of coolant accident frequency should be used to determine the \npriority of research needs. \nIn response to questions from Dr. Bonaca the staff and Mr. Hale explained that: \n•  the containment radiation monitors were within the scope of license renewal, however, \nno aging effects had been identified and no aging management programs were \nnecessary; and \n•  the main steam insolation valve air accumulators are within scope and have an aging \nmanagement program, however, the backup instrument air bottles, which are routinely \nreplaced, are not within scope and do not have an aging management program. \nChap. 3.3 -Engineered Safety Features: Ms. Meena Khanna, NRR \nMs. Khanna identified the systems reviewed by the staff. She noted that the applicant \nadequately identified the aging effects and applicable aging management programs for each \ncomponent of the engineered safety features system. \nChap. 3.4 -Auxiliary Systems: Mr. James Davis, NRR \nMr. James Davis, NRR, identified the systems reviewed by the staff. The Subcommittee \nmembers and the staff discussed inspections requirements for inaccessible areas and \noperating experience at other plants. The staff agreed to provide the Subcommittee an \nexplanation for why the intake structure does not have an aging management program. \nChap. 3.5 -Steam and Power Conversion Systems: Mr. James Davis, NRR \nMr. Davis identified the systems reviewed by the staff. \nChap. 3.6 -Structures and Components: Mr. Clifford Munson, NRR \nMr. Clifford Munson, NRR, identified the structural components and commodities reviewed by \nthe staff. \nChap. 3.7 -Electrical Components: Mr. Paul Shemanski, NRR \nMr. Paul Shemanski, NRR, identified the electrical component types subject to aging \nmanagement review. He noted that no aging management program was required for non­\nenvironmentally qualified (EO) medium voltage cables subject to moisture, since the cables \nwere designed with a lead sheath to prevent failure from water treeing due to moisture ingress. \nHe stated that on the basis of the staff's review, the applicant developed a new aging \nmanagement program for non-EO cables, connections, and electrical penetrations. The \nSubcommittee and Mr. Shemanski discussed the operating experience and testing of the lead \nsheath cables. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 6 \nSeptember 25,2001 \nChap. 3.8 -New Aging Management Programs: Ms. Andrea Keim, NRR \nMs. Andrea Keim, NRR, identi'fied the aging management programs that were developed to \nsupport the license renewal application. Dr. Shack questioned the meaningfulness of the one­\ntime inspection of small bore piping. \nMr. Barry Elliot, NRR, explained that cracking in small \nbore piping has not been a problem and that the one-time inspection is  intended to confirm the \nabsence of cracking. \nDr. Shack stated that the applicant's proposal to use a \nVT-1 visual inspection of baffle bolts was \ninsufficient, \nin and of itself, but would be acceptable if performed in conjunction with an \nultrasonic test. He stated that one-time inspections of reactor vessel internals using a \nVT-1 \nvisual inspection as implied by the SER, is  not sufficient. The staff agreed to review and modify \nthe SER to clarify this issue. \nField erected \ntanks internal inspection: Mr. Clifford Munson, NRR, explained the \nopen item concerning one-time inspection of condensate storage tanks, demineralized \nwater storage tanks, and the refueling water storage tank. \nGalvanic corrosion susceptibility inspection program: Mr. James Davis, NRR, \nidentified the specific component and commodity groups for which credit was taken for \nthis aging management program. \nHe described the use of baseline examinations and \none-time inspections. \nChap. 3.9 -\nExisting Aging Management Review: Ms. Andrea Keim, NRR \nMs. Keim identified the existing aging management programs reviewed by the staff. Dr. Ford \nstated that the staff should take a leadership role \nin resolving emerging aging degradation \nissues. Mr. Elliot explained that licensees are responsible for identifying emergent issues and \ndetermining appropriate resolution, where as the staff is responsible for confirming the \nadequacy of the proposed resolutions. \nChap. 4.0 - Time-Limited \nAging Analyses: Messrs. Barry Elliot and Paul Shemanski, NRR \nMr. Barry Elliot, NRR, identified the time-limited aging analyses (TLAAs) reviewed by the staff. \nReactor vessel \nirradiation embrittlement: Mr. Elliot noted that the applicant must \napply the chemistry factor ratio adjustment to the surveillance data when submitting the \n48 EFPY pressure-temperature curves for staff approval. He observed that the \ncircumferential weld between the nozzle belt and the intermediate shell approaches \nRT\nPTS screening criterion at end of life and should be tracked and considered by the \nlicensee \nin future submittals. \nThe Subcommittee and the staff discussed the appropriateness of allowing licensees to \ncontinue operating reactor pressure vessels that are within a few degrees of the \npressurized thermal shock screening criterion. The staff explained that the screening \ncriterion is very conservative and that if the criterion is exceeded licensees are required \nto perform plant-specific evaluations. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 7 \nSeptember \n25, 2001 \nMetal fatigue: Mr. Elliot identified an open item that requires the staff to complete a \nreview of the Westinghouse topical report regarding the evaluation of underclad \ncracking. \nEnvironmental review process: Mr. Shemanski noted the staff disagreed with the \napplicant as to which requirement \nin 10 CFR 54.21, \"Contents of application - Technical \ninformation,\" is being met, but accepts the application on the basis of the technical \nadequacy of the equipment qualification. The applicant committed to revise the EO \ndocumentation package to referenced the wear cycle aging effect on Westinghouse and \nJoy motors. \nWESTINGHOUSE TOPICAL REPORTS Mr. Barry Elliot, NRR \nMr. Elliot presented the materials used, the aging effects, aging management programs, \nTLAAs, renewal application action items, and significant technical issues for the following \nWestinghouse Topical Reports: \n•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14422 Rev. 2-A, \"Licensing Renewal \nEvaluation: Aging Managementfor Reactor Coolant Systems Supports.\" \n•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14574-A, \"License Renewal Evaluation: Aging \nManagement Evaluation for Pressurizers.\" \n•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14575-A, \"Aging Management Evaluation for \nClass 1 Piping and Associated Pressure Boundary Components.\" \n•  Westinghouse Energy Systems WCAP-14577 Rev. 1-A, \"License Renewal Evaluation: \nAging Management for Reactor Internals.\" \nMr. Elliot concluded that upon completion of all renewal application action items, applicants who \nreference the topical reports will have adequately demonstrated that the aging of components \nwithin the scope of the topical reports can be managed adequately for the period of extended \noperations. \nDr. Ford stated that the reports do not provide data concerning the effects on safety margins \nand questioned how a reviewer would be able to make a decision on the adequacy of the aging \nmanagement programs. The Subcommittee recognized that this information relates to the \ncurrent licensing basis and not to the license renewal process. \nDr. Bonaca stated that \nin order to make a clear distinction between the current licensing basis \nand license renewal commitments, the SERs should include a description of the philosophy and \nimplementation of the license renewal process. \nSUBCOMMITTEE COMMENTS, CONCERNS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS \nMr. Rosen requested additional information concerning allowing continued plant operations \nwhen the calculated reference temperature of the reactor pressure vessel (RT\nPTS) is within a \nfew degrees of the pressurized thermal shock screening criterion. \n\nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 8 \nSeptember 25, \n2001 \nMr. Rosen stated that in order to retain corporate knowledge, licensees should be required to \nprovide training on license renewal commitments to their employees. \nMr. Rosen stated that there should be clarity as to how EOPs should be used \nin the license \nrenewal screening process. \nDr. Ford stated the license renewal application identified aging management programs. \nHowever, Dr. Ford expressed his view that the topical reports did not contain sufficient data for \nreviewers to reach well supported decisions. The topical reports rely \non programs that are part \nof the current licensing basis. \nDrs. Shack and Bonaca stated that the table format used \nin the application was good and easy \nto follow. Dr. Shack noted that the application on the CD Rom was easy to use, however, the \nhard copy of the application was difficult to navigate. \nDr. Bonaca agreed with the staff's position concerning the evaluation of seismic ASME Class \nII \npipes located over Class I components \nThe Subcommittee agreed that the Westinghouse topical reports would be useful for future \napplicants. \nSTAFF AND INDUSTRY COMMITMENTS \nThe staff committed to provide the ACRS with a  reference for an explanation of the applicants \nscoping methodology. [Provided 9/25/01; Application for Renewed Operating License for \nTurkey Point Units 3 & \n4, pages 2.1-4 to 2.1-12] \nThe staff agreed to consider clarifying its approval for use of the VT\n-1 inspection for reactor \nvessel internals including baffle bolts. \nThe staff committed to provide the ACRS a copy of the Request for Additional Information \nregarding the integrity of the reactor pressure vessel. [Provided 9/25/0\"\\] \nSUBCOMMITTEE DECISIONS \nThe Subcommittee decided not to prepare an interim letter nor a letter concerning the \nWestinghouse Topical Reports. \nThe Subcommittee requested that the staff present an abbreviate version of its presentation \nregarding the SER and Westinghouse Topical Reports to the ACRS on October \n5,2001. \nFOLLOW-UP ACTIONS \nThe Subcommittee plans to visit Turkey Point Units 3 and 4, after the resolution of the \nremaining open items are documented \nin the SER. \n\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• \n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• \nMinutes: Plant License Renewal Subcommittee 9 \nSeptember 25, 2001 \nPRESENTATION SLIDES AND HANDOUTS PROVIDED DURING THE MEETING \nThe presentation slides and handouts used during the meeting are available in the ACRS office \nfiles or as attachments \nto the transcript. \nBACKGROUND MATERIAL PROVIDED TO THE SUBCOMMIITEE: \n1.

The presentations to the \nSubcommittees are summarized below. \nOpening Remarks \nMr. Sieber,  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Plant Operations, convened the meeting and \nmade a few introductory remarks. The purpose of the meeting was to gather information \nregarding the current status and condition of Browns Ferry (BF) Unit 1 to support ACRS reviews \nof the license renewal application for BF Units \n1,2, and 3 and the restart of BF Unit 1. \nDr. Bonaca stated that the Committee is concerned about how BF Units 2 and 3 operating \nexperience applies to BF Unit \n1, restart inspections, material condition, corrective action \nprogram, restart activities with license renewal, and periodic inspections vs. one-time inspection \nshould be clear. \nMr. Leitch stated he is concerned about how BF Units 2 and 3 operating experience applies to \nBF Unit \n1, and he is concerned about the uprated power level. \nMr. Barton stated he is concerned that some equipment is 30 years old. \nMr. Sieber called upon Mr. P.T. Kuo of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) to \nmake a statement. Mr. Kuo introduced NRR staff members present. He said TVA submitted \nan application for license renewal of BF Units \n1,2, and 3 on December 31,2003 (ADAMS \nAccession No. ML040060361). Mr. Kuo stated TVA subsequently submitted Extended Power \nUprate (EPU) applications for Unit 1 and Units 2 \n& 3 on June 28,2004 (ADAMS Accession No. \nML041840109), and June 25, 2004 (ADAMS Accession No. ML041840301), respectively. He \nsaid the EPU has been decoupled from the license renewal application (LRA) based on a TVA \nletter dated January 7, 2005 (ADAMS Accession No. ML050100180). Mr. Kuo explained the BF \nLRA is  based on the current power level. He said the staff Safety Evaluation Report (SER) with \nopen items (ADAMS Accession No. ML05221 0484) was supplied to the ACRS on August 9, \n2005. Mr. Kuo stated ACRS Members visited the BF site on August \n24,2005. Dr. Bonaca \nasked about the modifications for the EPU. Mr. Kuo answered the modifications will be \nexplained at the October \n5,2005, Plant License Renewal Subcommittee meeting. He said the \nstaff is  not making any presentations today. \nMr. Sieber turned it  over to Bill Couch of TVA to begin the discussion. \nDiscussion \nMr. Couch introduced TVA staff in  attendance. He stated the following are agenda items: \nRegulatory Background, BF Unit 1 Fidelity with Units 2 and 3, License Renewal Application, \nEPU Impact on License Renewal, and Summary. Mr. Couch stated there are three major \nNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval issues: (1) license renewal at current power, \n(2) EPU, and (3) Unit 1 restart. He said ACRS approval is  required for the LRA and the EPU. \nMr. Couch stated 'final approval is required for Unit 1 restart by the Region \nII Regional \nAdministrator and NRR Director. \n2\n \n\nRegulatory Background \nMr. Couch provided the presentation slides regarding regulatory background. He said the three\n \nBrowns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units consist of a General Electric Type 4 boiling water reactor with\n \na Mark I containment that were designed and constructed by TVA. Mr. Couch explained Units\n \n1 and 2 were licensed \nin 1973 and 1974, respectively, and both units shutdown after the March\n \n22, 1975 Browns Ferry \n'fire. He said Unit 1 and 2 were returned to service in 1976 and\n \noperated until 1985. Mr. Couch stated Unit 3 was licensed \nin 1976 and operated until 1985. He\n \nsaid TVA voluntarily shut down all three units \nin March 1985 to correct a variety of issues. Mr.\n \nCouch stated Unit 1 has approximately 10 years of operations, Unit 2 has approximately 23\n \nyears of operations, and Unit 3 has approximately 18 years of operations. He said Units 2 and\n \n3 were restarted \nin 1991 and 1995, respectively. Mr. Couch said TVA submitted a proposed\n \nupdate to the regulatory framework for Unit 1 \nin December 2003.\n \nNote:\n \nThe TVA regulatory framework letter is  dated December 13, 2002 (ADAMS Accession No.\n \nML023600026). \nIn a letter dated August 14, 2003 (ADAMS Accession No. ML032190680), the\n \nNRC issued the Regulatory Framework for the Restart of Browns Ferry Unit \n1. This letter lists\n \nthe significant regulatory actions that require resolution before restart. Region \n1\\ has been\n \nmonitoring the Unit 1 recovery efforts.\n \nMr. Couch stated the Unit 1 NRC oversight is  governed by Manual Chapter 2509, \"Browns\n \nFerry Unit 1 Restart Project Inspection Program.\" He said the restart oversight panel is\n \nscheduled to begin \nin Fall 2005 and will provide its recommendation to the Region II Regional\n \nAdministrator and the NRR Director for Unit 1 restart approval.\n \nMr. Couch explained when the LRA and EPU applications were submitted. He said LRA\n \napproval is expected \nin June 2006 and EPU approval is expected prior to Unit 1 restart in May\n \n2007.\n \nMember Comments on the Regulatory Background\n \nMr. Leitch asked if the design discussed \nin the LRA is the present design or the future design.\n \nMr. Couch answered the LRA design is the future design at the EPU conditions. Mr. Leitch\n \nasked about piping modifications. Mr. Couch provided three handouts: (1) Description of\n \nModifications Planned for Unit 1 Restart, (2) Table 1 -Browns Ferry Unit 1 Restart Poject ­\n\nPiping System Replacements, and  (3) [Non-Destructive Examination] NDE Examinations\n \nPerformed for Original Non-Replaced Piping. Mr. Leitch asked when the Units expect to reach\n \nthe EPU conditions provided TVA receives approval of the EPU applications. Mr. Couch\n \nresponded Unit 1 and 2 expect to irnplement EPU \nin 2007 and Unit 3 in 2008. He said Unit 1 is\n \nthe lead BF plant for EPU. Mr. Leitch asked about procedures at BF. Mr. Couch answered that\n \neach Unit has its own set of procedures.\n \nMr. Sieber asked if  Browns Ferry is  an AppendiX R plant. Mr. Couch responded that Units 2\n \nand 3 meet Appendix R with five exemptions and Unit 1 will be brought into compliance with\n \nAppendix \nR. Mr. Sieber asked what version of Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) did\n \nTVA use. Mr. Couch stated Revision \n1; however, this was corrected to Revision 0 later in the\n \nmeeting. Mr. Sieber questioned which topical reports are being used for the EPU. Mr. Couch\n \nanswered that TVA is using General Electric (GE) topical reports EL\nTR1 and ELTR2 for the\n \nEPU.\n \n3\n \n\nDr. Bonaca asked if the proposed 2002 LRA has changed significantly to today. Mr. Couch\n \nresponded that originally in 2002 \nTVA was working on LRA for Units 2  and 3 only; however,\n \nadded Unit 1 based on the 2002 \nTVA Board decision to restart Unit 1. He said TVA had a good\n \nhandle on what components needed to be replaced based on its experience restarting Units 2\n \nand 3. Mr. Couch said the \nLRA application was complete when it was submitted to the NRC in\n \nDecember 2003. Dr. Bonaca stated there is  no coherent description \nof the Unit 2 and 3\n \noperating experience applying to Unit 1 in the LRA application or the staff \nSER with open items.\n \nMr. Couch responded that \nTVA will work with the staff to come up with words for the SER. Mr.\n \nRam Subbaratnam \nof NRR stated it will be in  the final SER. Dr. Bonaca stated BF Unit 1 will\n \nstart-up \nat a 20% higher power level. He said he would expect a commitment in the LRA for\n \nTVA to submit a  report a couple of years before entering the period of extended operation\n \nexplaining and justifying the EPU for the license renewal.\n \nUnit 1 Fidelity with Units 2  & 3\n \nMr. \nJoe Valente of TVA presented the slides regarding Unit 1 fidelity with Units 2  and 3. He\n \nsaid the scope \nof Unit 1 restart project incorporated the same restart programs as Unit 2 and 3\n \nand upgrades installed on Units 2  and 3  since restart. Mr. Valente stated Unit 1 will \nbe\n \noperationally the same as Units 2 and 3. He said Unit 1 will have the same systems,\n \nequipment, operating procedures, Technical Specifications, and Updated Safety Analysis\n \nReport. Mr. Valente said \nTVA deleted the low pressure coolant injection motor generator sets.\n \nMr. Valente described three items from its nuclear performance plan: (1) design baseline\n \nverification program, (2) fire protection - Appendix \nR, and (3) Intergranular Stress Corrosion\n \nCracking. He described the Unit 1 lay-up program. Mr. Valente described \nthe assessment\n \nprocess for the condition \nof Unit 1. He stated 39 Unit 1 mechanical systems are in scope for\n \nUnit 1 recovery and \n47 Unit 1 mechanical systems are in scope for license renewal. Mr.\n \nValente stated \none system was completely replaced. He described the detailed work\n \nperformed for 3  systems: (1) high pressure coolant injection (HPCI), (2) reactor water cleanup\n \n(RWCU), and (3) feedwater (FW). Mr. Valente described the long-term passive components\n \nreplaced.\n \nMr. R.J. \nJones of TVA presented the slides regarding Unit 1 system return to service process.\n \nHe described the system plant acceptance evaluation (SPAE) process, the phase I system pre­\n\noperability checklist (SPOC) process, and the phase \nII SPOC process. Mr. Jones described the\n \nUnit 1 restart test program. \nHe said the Unit 1 restart test program is the same as the\n \nprograms performed on Unit 2 and 3. Mr. \nJones described the testing for 3  systems: (1) HPCI,\n \n(2) RWCU, and (3) \nFW. He described the integrated/power ascension test program. Mr. Jones \nsaid Phase 1 testing is open vessel testing. He said Phase \nII testing will be up to 55% power. \nMr. \nJones stated Phase 3 will be 55% to 83% power. He said Phase 4 will be from 83% to \n100%. Mr. Jones stated that \n100% will be EPU conditions or 120% of the current licensed \npower level. He said Phase 4 will be performed in plateaus of \n2% - 5%. Mr. Jones stated TVA \nwill not perform large transient testing for Unit 1, because he said it offers minimal benefit and \ndoes not justify the risk. Mr. \nJones stated that TVA is increasing the staff by 126 people. He \nsaid the Operations crews work 12 hour shifts on a  6 \nweek schedule. Mr. Jones stated BF has \n2  simulators: \none for Unit 3 and one for Unit 1. He said the Emergency Plan Guidelines (EPGs) \nare plant-specific. \nMember \nComments on Unit 1 Fidelitv with Units 2  & 3 \nMr. Leitch asked \nwhy TVA deleted the low pressure coolant injection motor generator sets. Mr. \nValente answered that it  simplified the electrical system. Mr. Leitch asked if \nTVA re-did its \nProbabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) based on modifications to Unit 1. Mr. Valente responded \nthat \nTVA re-did its Level 1 PRA and provided a slide with the results (Core Damage Frequency \n(CDF) \nat EPU conditions: Unit 1 -1.77 E-6; Unit 2 -1.55 E-6; and Unit 3  -2.76 E-6). Mr. Leitch \nasked if \nany EPU modifications were done due to PRA. Mr. Valente stated TVA increased the \nvolume in  the Standby Liquid Control System. Mr. Leitch asked how \nTVA came up with the list \nfor the performance plan. Mr. Valente responded \nthese special programs were developed due \nto problems \nat shutdown in 1985. Mr. Leitch asked about net positive suction head (NPSH) on \n4\n \n\n'. \nEmergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) pumps. Mr. Valente answered that TVA takes credit \nfor containment overpressure. \nMr. Leitch expressed a concern regarding the blockage of \nElectro-Hydraulic Control (EHC) piping. \nMr. Couch responded that TVA plans to work with GE \nto flush the EHC and lube oil system. \nMr. Leitch asked about medium voltage cables. Mr. \nValente stated that TVA has not replaced medium voltage cables; however, TVA has performed \n4 \nkV cable splices. Mr. Leitch asked how many Technical Specification (TS) changes are \nneeded for BF. \nMr. Couch stated there are 21 TS changes:  16 submitted and 5 completed. Mr. \nLeitch asked if Quality Assurance (QA) is  involved in the SPOC process. Mr. Jones responded \nthat Quality Control (QC) is \nin the process and QA looked at 6 systems returned to service with \nno findings. \nMr. Leitch asked about restart test procedures. Mr. Jones answered that TVA has \nsurveillance instructions, surveillance tests, post-maintenance tests (PMTs), and technical \nprocedures. Mr. Leitch asked when would TVA test if the RWCU pumps worked. Mr. Jones \nresponded it would occur after SPOC Phase I and before SPOC Phase II. Mr. Leitch asked \nhow long the Phase 1 power ascension test program would last. \nMr. Jones responded Phase 1 \npower ascension test program will take approximately 3 weeks. Mr. Leitch asked if  a turbine \noverspeed test will be performed as part of the Phase 2 power ascension test program. Mr. \nJones responded that a turbine overspeed test will be conducted during the Phase 2 power \nascension test program. Mr. Leitch asked about the closure time of the Main Steam Isolation \nValve (MSIV) at the EPU higher steam flow conditions and how can TVA justify a MSIV closure \ntime of 3 - 5 seconds without dynamic testing. \nMr. Couch responded that BF 1 has a steam \nflow rate, not \nin terms of mass flow rate, but in terms of velocity, significantly below what other \nplants are running at the EPU conditions and TVA performs stroke time testing on Unit 1 the \nsame as Units 2 and 3. \nMr. Leitch expressed concern that the stroke time cannot be ensured \nat EPU conditions without a dynamic test. \nDr. Denning asked for an explanation \nin the different PRA numbers for the three units. Mr. \nCouch responded TVA has shared pumps such as the Residual Heat Removal (RHR). Dr. \nDenning asked if  any new scenarios developed due to the higher power level of EPU. Mr. \nValente said no. Dr. Denning asked if  TVA plans to perform PRA \nin other modes such as fire \nPRA or shutdown PRA. \nMr. Couch responded TVA does not plan to perform a fire PRA or \nshutdown PRA. Dr. Denning asked if  TVA uses an on-line risk monitor. Mr. Couch responded \nthat TVA does use an on-line risk monitor and it \nis called Sentinel. Dr. Denning asked what \nalternatives did TVA consider instead of taking credit for containment overpressure. \nMr. Couch \nresponded that TVA looked for pumps with less NPSH and could not identify any pump to meet \nthe 3 psi short-term and long-term containment pressure. Dr. Denning asked if the credit for \ncontainment overpressure was needed for a 5% power uprate. Mr. Couch responded yes. Dr. \nDenning asked if the 83% power \nin the Phase 3 power ascension test program the same as the \ncurrent 100% licensed power level. \nMr. Couch responded that 83% at the EPU conditions \nrepresents the current 100% licensed power level. Dr. Denning asked how TVA looks at \ntransient performance. Does TVA use a thermal hydraulic calculation to compare plant \nperformance during testing? How does TVA judge plant performance during power ascension? \nHow long will Phase 3 last? Mr. Couch stated TVA is  using the simulator for plant performance \ncomparisons and Phase 3 will last approximately 70 days. Dr. Denning asked if  TVA had pre­\ndefined values \nor bars for various equipment and instrument performance parameters. Mr. \nCouch stated that TVA does not have pre-defined bars. Dr. Denning stated he is  not \ncomfortable without pre-defined bars and Mr. Couch said TVA can do it. \nDr. Kress asked if  TVA plans to do a Level 3  PRA. Mr. Couch responded no. \nMr. John Barton asked about fire protection modifications. \nMr. Valente answered that all the \nfire sprinklers were replaced. Mr. Barton asked about the fuse program. Mr. Valente \nresponded that all the fuses and fuse holders that support Unit 1 recovery have been replaced. \nMr. Barton asked about re-packing old valves. \nMr. Valente responded that TVA cycled all small \nvalves. Mr. Barton expressed his concern that cycling the valves may not be adequate to \ndetermine the condition of the packing. Mr. Barton asked if the FW tubes were replaced and \nwhat was the tube material. \nMr. Valente stated the FW heaters were not replaced and the tube \nmaterial \nis 304 stainless steel. Mr. Barton asked about the shroud inspections, what were the \ncorrective actions, and asked about coatings \nin containment. Mr. Valente said there were minor \n5\n \n\nindications on the shroud welds and there were no through-wall flaws. He said there were no \ncorrective actions at this time regarding the shroud. \nMr. Valente stated the coatings in \ncontainment looked good overall. Mr. Barton asked why TVA performed 4 kV splices instead of \nreplacing the cable. \nMr. Valente stated it was due to conduit problems. Mr. Barton asked if \nTVA owns the BF switchyard and how work is  coordinated \nin the sWitchyard. Mr. Couch stated \nthat a TVA subsidiary owns the switchyard and all work is  coordinated through the control room. \nMr. Barton asked if labels must be permanent after the completion of SPOC Phase II. Mr. \nJones answered that the labels must be permanent after completion of SPOC Phase II. \nMr. \nBarton asked about pressure testing. Mr. Jones responded TVA performs in-service leak test. \nMr. Barton stated that a large transient test can find problems. \nMr. Sieber asked if the combustible loading was analyzed for abandoned circuits in-place. Mr. \nValente responded that abandon circuits are taken into account \nin the analysis. Mr. Sieber \nasked about the Appendix R exemptions. Mr. Valente stated TVA has 5 exemptions: (1) short­\nterm core uncovery, (2) fire suppression \nin the control room, (3) RHR pump room lack of \nseparation is  compensated by a water fire curtain, (4) intervening combustibles - fire loading \nlow, and (5) fixed suppression \nin the control building. Mr. Sieber asked about the condition of \nthe station batteries. Mr. Valente answered the station batteries have been replaced. \nMr. \nSieber asked what are the open items for Unit 1 for Three Mile Island action items. Mr. Valente \nresponded the control room human performance/factors analysis. \nMr. Sieber asked if  hangers \nand supports were replaced or upgraded. Mr. Valente stated 85% of the hangers were \nchanged due to a new response spectrum \nin the seismic analysis. Mr. Sieber asked if the \ntransmission system operator has the same type of procedures as the plant. Mr. Valente said \nthe transmission system operator has the same level of procedures as the plant. \nMr. Sieber \nasked if TVA performed a heavy loads lifting analysis and who is the TVA crane manufacturer. \nMr. Couch responded that TVA has performed a heavy load analysis and the crane \nmanufacturer is  Ederer. \nMr. Sieber asked who signs for the acceptance after the completion of \nSPOC Phase I \n& II. Mr. Jones responded that the shift manager and plant manager sign for \nthe acceptance after the completion of SPOC Phase I \n& II. Mr. Sieber asked how engineering \ncalculations are checked at BF. Mr. Couch responded that TVA engineering calculations are \npeer-reviewed. Mr. Sieber stated that TVA has not performed a large transient test above the \ncurrent 100% licensed power level. \nDr. Bonaca asked if there were problems with lay-up such as moisture concern or lube oil, if \nTVA took credit for lay-up, and one-time inspections vs. periodic inspections. Dr. Bonaca \nstated that there is  no discussion \nin the application or the SER with open items regarding these \ninspections. Mr. Couch stated TVA will perform baseline inspections, perform inspections prior \nto entering the extended period of operation, perform inspections during the period of extended \noperation, then assess the extent and frequency of further inspections. \nLicense Renewal Application \nMr. Rich \nDelong of TVA presented slides regarding the license renewal. He said the lRA was \nsubmitted on December 31,2003. \nMr. Delong stated the NRC SER with open items was \nissued on August \n9, 2005. He said there were two open items: (1) drywell shell corrosion and \n(2) stress relaxation of the core plate hold-down bolts. \nMr. Delong stated there are 39 Aging \nManagement Programs (AMPs) total, with 38 common to all three units and 1 for Unit 1 only. \nHe said the Unit 1 specific AMP is  the Unit 1 Periodic Inspection program. Mr. \nDelong stated \nthere are 12 existing AMPs requiring no enhancements since they are consistent with GALL. \nHe said there are 10 existing AMPs requiring enhancements for all Units in order to comply with \nGALL. Mr. \nDelong stated there are 11 existing AMPs revised to include Unit 1 and are already \nconsistent with GALL. He said there are 6 new AMPs. \nMr. Delong described the Unit 1 \nPeriodic Inspection Program. \nMr. Joe McCarthy of TVA presented slides on operating experience. He said Unit 1 met the \nrequirement of 10 CFR 54.17(c). Mr. McCarthy stated that operating experience is  not limited \nto that of the license renewal applicant. \n6\n \n\nMember Comments on License Renewal Application \nDr. Bonaca stated the lRA and the SER with open items is confusing regarding one-time \ninspections and periodic inspections. \nDr. Bonaca said the new AMP for all three units regarding \nOne-Time Inspection Program and the new AMP for Unit 1 only Unit 1 Periodic Inspection \nProgram need to be kept separate \nin the SER. Dr. Bonaca stated he would expect TVA to \nperform a periodic inspection 2 years before entering the period of extended operation and at \nleast one inspection during the extended operation period. Mr. \nDelong responded TVA will \nmake a determination of a frequency of periodic inspections after reviewing the rate of \ndegradation. \nDr. Bonaca stated the license renewal rule has never interpreted other utilities \nunits operating experience can be applied generically. \nDr. Bonaca said there is no operating \nexperience for Unit 1 since lay-up. \nDr. Bonaca said that Unit 1 does not need 20 years of \noperating experience but Unit 1 has not started up. \nDr. Bonaca stated that nowhere in the SER \nor application is the justification for using Units 2 and 3 operating experience acceptable to \napply to Unit \n1. Mr. McCarthy stated that TVA will work with the staff to put the justification into \nthe SER. Mr. Subbaratnam stated that the staff would need a letter from TVA regarding this \njustification to get it \non the docket. \nExtended Power Uprate Impact \non License Renewal \nMr. Couch presented slides regarding the EPU impact on license renewal. He said the EPU \nwas prepared using GE's \nElTR1 and ElTR2 topical reports. Mr. Couch stated Unit 1 has GE \n14 fuel and Units 2 and 3 are transitioning to Framatome \nA-1 0 fuel. He said the original \nlicensed thermal power for Unit 1 \nis 3293 MWt and the requested EPU power is 3952 MWt. Mr. \nCouch described the modifications required to support EPU. He also explained the parameter \nincreases for the various systems. \nMember Comments \non Extended Power Uprate Impact on License Renewal \nDr. Bonaca stated he would expect TVA to supply a report to the NRC for review which justifies \nthe acceptability of entering the extended period of operation with the extended power uprate \nprior to entering the period. Dr. Bonaca stated that TVA needs to look at EPU before the \nlicense renewal extended period since BF Unit 1 \nis unique; it operated for 10 years, was in lay­\nup for 22 years, then will have only 4 years of operation at 120%. \nSummary \nMr. Couch stated there are three major NRC approval issues: (1) license renewal at current \npower, (2) EPU, and (3) Unit 1 restart. He said ACRS approval \nis required for the lRA and the \nEPU. Mr. Couch stated final approval \nis required for Unit 1 restart by the Region II Regional \nAdministrator and NRR Director. \nMr. Couch appreciated the Committee for allowing TVA the opportunity to present information. \nMember Comments \nMr. Sieber stated that the ACRS has statutory responsibility for license renewal and power \nuprate. He said the ACRS \nis interested in reviewing the BF Unit 1 Restart Oversight Panel \nreport when it \nis completed. \nDr. Bonaca stated the meeting for the Subcommittee on Plant License Renewal will meet on \nOctober 5, 2005. He said he would expect the meeting to be similar to other License Renewal \nSubcommittee meeting with some additional topics related to Unit 1 such as lay-up and the \njustification to use Units 2 and 3 operating experience for Unit \n1. \nMr. Sieber thanked TVA for its presentation and he said it was helpful. Then, Mr. Sieber \nsolicited comments from the ACRS consultants and Members. \n7 \n\nMr. Leitch stated the presentation was helpful especially the list of modifications. He said the \nclarification of the modifications performed \non the three units was good. Mr. Leitch expressed \nhis concern regarding the lack of EPU large transient testing. He stated \nhe is especially \nconcerned regarding the closure of the MSIV at 120% power. Mr. Leitch stated the MSIV \nclosure at 120% power needs to be demonstrated. \nMr. Barton stated the presentation was helpful especially knowing what \nis being replaced. He \nexpressed concern regarding the lack of large transient testing and the timing of the \napplication. \nDr. Denning stated the presentation was helpful. He said separation of \nEPU and license \nrenewal \nis key. He said he does not see a concern regarding periodic inspections. Dr. Denning \nstated EPU and start-up are not separable. Sr. Denning asked rhetorically \nif TVA should do a \nmajor trip test. He said Unit 1 will be at different conditions than before. \nDr. Kress stated the presentation was helpful. He said transient testing should be a condition \nfor restart and \nis certainly an issue for EPU. Dr. Denning stated he would like to see a Level 3 \nPRA and the impact of risk on the Environmental Impact Statement. He said the SER ignores \nthis risk. \nDr. Bonaca stated the presentation was helpful. He said he would like to see the \ndocumentation of the justification of using the Unit 2 and 3 operating experience for Unit 1 \nin \nthe SER. Dr. Bonaca stated the periodic inspection program is good. He said large transient \ntesting needs to be done. Dr. Bonaca stated this testing will be looked at as part of the EPU \nreview. \nMr. Sieber endorsed Dr. Bonaca's comments. He thanked the staff for the SER and thanked \nTVA for the presentation. Mr. Sieber adjourned the meeting. \nSubcommittee Decisions and Follow-up Actions \nThe Subcommittee Chairman will summarize the discussions to the full Committee during the \nOctober 2005 ACRS meeting. \nBackground Materials Provided to the Committee \n1.

Which systems were replaced entirely? Why were they replaced? Which systems were \nleft intact? Which systems were partially replaced? What was the logic/basis for only \npartially replacing these systems? What \nis the schedule for future replacements? How \nmuch has been completed? How much still needs to \nbe done? Regarding system \nreplacements or partial system replacements, are there firm commitments or just plans? \nWhat are the criteria for replacement? \n2.  Which components were replaced? Why were they replaced? What was the logic and \nbasis for the component replacement? How much has been completed? How much still \nneeds to be done? Are there firm commitments or just plans? What are the criteria for \nreplacement? \n3.  Discuss maintenance of Unit 1 equipment during the shutdown period. Any unusual \naging of systems, structures, and components (SSCs) during the shutdown period? \nWhat criteria were used for evaluation? What standards were used? \n4.  Which equipment was in lay-up? How was the lay-up performed? What standards were \nused? Were EPRllay-up guidelines used? If \nso, what standards were used prior to the \nissuance of EPRI lay-up guidelines? What kind of inspection was performed on the laid­\nup equipment? What were the results? What criteria were used for evaluation? \n5.  What kinds of NDE were performed on equipment, cables, and piping that were not \nreplaced? How did the equipment, cables, and piping fare since 1985? \nIs there a \nprojection of when that equipment, cables, and piping would need to \nbe replaced? Are \nthe projections by analysis or engineering judgment? \n6.  Over the years since Unit 1 has been shut down, most of the BWR fleet has been \nmodified \nin significant ways. Will Unit 1 be modified to incorporate these changes? \n(e.g., Materials? 316 L \nin recirc lines or MSIP or what? Core spray and RWCU system \nmaterials? Capping of \nCRD return line? Removal of LPCI loop selection logic? RWCU \nPump and piping modifications? Will there be Hydrogen water chemistry? Noble \nmetals?) Will there be Alternate \nrod injection? What work and/or inspections have \nbeen performed on the Shroud? Will Unit 1 implement the programs associated with \nthe BWR Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP)? Explain the status of implementing \nBWRVIP programs. \n7.  How are the operators and other permanent staff being expanded to cover the additional \nrequirements of a third unit (Unit 1)? How is the training for the additional crew \nmembers being provided? Is  it a completely new crew or upgraded crew from Units 2 \nand \n3? What are the major differences between Units 1, 2, and 3? EPGs are plant \nspecific and were developed after Unit 1 was shut down. What EPGs are being used? \n8.  Is Unit 1 being modified in any significant way from Units 2 and 3? If so, will these \nmodifications be incorporated into Units 2 and \n3? When will the simulator be modified? \nWhich unit will it  replicate? \n9.  Is Unit 1 in a separate security/radiological area from 2 and 3? Do permanent plant \n\nADVISORY COMMITIEE ON REACTOR SAFEGUARDS\n \nSUBCOMMITIEE MEETING ON PLANT LICENSE RENEWAL/PLANT OPERATIONS\n \nSeptember 21! 2005\n \nDate\n \nPLEASE PRINT \nNAME AFFILIATION \nW,II;....-\\J.

What are the criteria for \nreplacement? \n3.  Discuss maintenance of Unit 1 equipment during the shutdown period.  Any unusual \naging of systems, structures, and components (SSCs) during the shutdown period? \nWhat criteria were used for evaluation? What standards were used? \n4.  Which equipment was in lay-up? How was the lay-up performed? What standards were \nused? Were EPRllay-up guidelines used? If so, what standards were used prior to the \nissuance of EPRI lay-up guidelines? What kind of inspection was performed \non the laid­\nup equipment? What were the results? What criteria were used for evaluation? \n5.  What kinds of NDE were performed on equipment, cables, and piping that were not \nreplaced? How did the equipment, cables, and piping fare since 1985? \nIs there a \nprojection of when that equipment, cables, and piping would need to \nbe replaced? Are \nthe projections \nby analysis or engineering judgment? \n6.  Over the years since Unit 1 has been shut down, most of the BWR fleet has been \nmodified \nin significant ways. Will Unit 1 be modified to incorporate these changes? \n(e.g., Materials? 316 L \nin recirc lines or MSIP or what? Core spray and RWCU system \nmaterials? Capping of CRD return line? Removal of LPCI loop selection logic? RWCU \nPump and piping modifications? Will there be Hydrogen water chemistry? Noble \nmetals?) Will there be Alternate \nrod injection? What work and/or inspections have \nbeen performed \non the Shroud? Will Unit 1 implement the programs associated with \nthe BWR Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP)? Explain the status of implementing \nBWRVIP programs. \n7.  How are the operators and other permanent staff being expanded to cover the additional \nrequirements of a third unit (Unit 1)? How \nis the training for the additional crew \nmembers being provided? Is it a completely new crew or upgraded crew from Units 2 \nand \n3? What are the major differences between Units 1, 2, and 3? EPGs are plant \nspecific and were developed after Unit 1 was shut down. What EPGs are being used? \n8.  Is Unit 1 being modified in any significant way from Units 2 and 3? If so, will these \nmodifications be incorporated into Units 2 and \n3? When will the simulator be modified? \nWhich unit will \nit replicate? \n9.  Is Unit 1 in a separate security/radiological area from 2 and 3? Do permanent plant \n\nstaff have free access to that area? \n10.  Explain the pre-operation and start up test program for Unit \n1. \n11.  What is the logic behind the sequencing of power uprates, license renewal and restart of \nUnit \n1? \n12.  Will the licensee perform large transient testing for Unit 1? If not, what testing is \nplanned to support the extended power uprate? \n13.  Explain \nin specific detail how Unit 1 meets the requirements of Part 54 regarding 20 \nyears of operating experience. \n14.  \nWe would like to hear from the staff about what construction type inspections are \nplanned during the modification period. Which inspection modules will they use? What \nis their estimate of man-hours to be expended in inspections? What tests will be \nperformed? What has the staff asked for? What \nis the staff requiring, as far as \nconstruction information and component information. What \nis the staff asking for \nrelated to construction inspections, lSI and \n1ST? What does the staff already have? \nThis project \nis like building a new plant, so the inspection effort should be similar. \n15.  We would like to see lists of piping and equipment to be replaced. A set of marked-up \nP&IDs would be helpful (but not required). \n16.  TVA stated that they are not taking credit for lay up. Does this mean that a full set of \ninspections to piping, systems, and components to remain \nin place for use in the rebuilt \nplant will have to undergo extensive inspections to declare that these piping, systems, \nand components are ready for service and will perform as designed. The regular lSI \nand \n1ST programs may not be sufficient unless they are expanded and supplemented. \n\nJuly 22, 2005 \nMEMORANDUM TO: File \nFROM: \nJohn G.

The purpose of the \nmeeting was to discuss TVA's Browns Ferry Unit 1 restart status. The meeting announcement was \nmade public \non June 7,2005 (ADAMS Accession No. ML051590140). The meeting was classified as \na Category 1 meeting. One member of the public, a newspaper reporter, was \nin attendance. \nAttachment 1 \nis the list of meeting attendees. Attachment 2 is a copy of TVA's presentation slides, \n''Tennessee Valley Authority Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 1 Status.\" Attachment 3 is a copy of the \nNRC's presentation slides, \"NRC Oversight of the Browns Ferry Unit 1 Recovery Effort.\" \nABSTRACT \nTVA stated that Browns Ferry Unit 1 is on-schedule for start-up in May 2007. The current status \nis that 58-percent \nof the overall work is complete. \nMEETING SUMMARY \nTVA PRESENTATION \nDr. William Travers, the Regional Administrator for Region II, opened the meeting with \nintroductory remarks. Dr. Travers introduced Mr. Bill Couch, \nTVA Browns Ferry Site Licensing \nManager, for the TVA presentation. \nMr. Couch provided the introduction, described the agenda for the presentation, introduced the \nTVA presenters, then turned over the presentation to Mr. Jon Rupert of TVA. \nMr. Rupert explained the recent Unit 1 organizational changes (see Slide 4 of Attachment 2). Mr. \nRupert stated that the project schedule for start-up was on-schedule for May 2007 and on-budget. \nHe described the significant milestones: torus work is complete, torus is filled, plan to finish \ndrywell work \nin October 2005, plan to complete bulk work period for modifications in March 2006, \ncable pulling has just started, and plan to turnover systems to Operations \nin Spring 2006. \nMr. \nJoe Valente of TVA explained that overall 83-percent of the engineering is complete. He \ndescribed that the engineering input for programmatic submittals are completed. Mr. Valente \nstated that the following engineering activities remain to be completed: field support, system \ntesting, surveillance instructions, post-maintenance testing, integrated testing, System Plant \nAcceptance Evaluations (SPAE), and System Pre-Operability Checklists (SPOCs). Mr. Valente \n\nstated that there are 63 tests for recovery. Mr. Ed Hackett, Director of Project Directorate II in the \nDivision of Licensing Project Management of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), \nexplained that the staff has a challenging review of MELLA \n+, that the review may not be \ncompleted when TVA needs \nit, and wanted TVA to be aware of this challenge. TVA stated that \nthey are aware of the MELLA \n+ challenge. TVA explained that the design work is on-going and \nthey are working with General Electric (GE) and plan to submit the reload report to NRR six \nmonths prior to restart. \nMr. Elvis Hollins of TVA described the modifications and maintenance accomplishments since the \nlast meeting \non September 9,2004 (ADAMS Accession 1\\10. ML042880292). Mr. Hollins stated \nthat the following were replaced: main bank transformer, large bore piping in the drywell, Reactor \nWater Cleanup (RWCU) piping, RWCU pumps, and fire protection piping on reactor building \nelevations 593, 621, and 639. He stated that TVA \nis currently working on the fire protection piping \non the 565 elevation of the reactor building. Mr. Hollins stated that the main generator rewind and \nrotor balance are complete. He explained that the torus coating project is complete as well as the \nHPCI turbine overhaul. Mr. Hollins stated that work \nis completed on the torus fill, vessel flood-up, \nand fuel pool gate removal. He explained the following major work \nis in-progress: cable tray, \nconduit and support installation; large and small bore pipe replacement; pipe hanger installation; \nlarge pump and motor refurbishment; control room design review modifications; mechanical stress \nimprovements of welds; \nGE in-vessel work. Mr. Hollins stated that the current status is 58-percent \nof the overall work \nis complete. \nMr. R.G. Jones of TVA explained the process for returning systems to service (see Slide \n11 of \nAttachment 2). Mr. Jones explained that TVA has completed 16 SPAEs out of \n61 SPAEs and 3 \nSPAEs are scheduled \nin the next six months. He explained that TVA has completed 8  Phase I \nSPOCs and 3 Phase I SPOCs are scheduled \nin the next six months. Mr. Jones stated that TVA \nhas completed 3 Phase \nII SPOCs and 9 are scheduled in the next six months. Mr. Jones \nexplained TVA's foreign material exclusion and vessel cleaning programs. He stated that TVA \nplans to perform the following as part of the Restart Test Program: component testing, post­\nmaintenance testing, post-modification testing, system testing, and integrated system testing. \nNRC staff asked if TVA plans to perform large transient testing. TVA responded that they do not \nplan to perform large transient testing and TVA plans to perform the same test program as they \nused for Units 2 and \n3. Mr. Jones stated that TVA plans to have the following plateaus for the \npower ascension over a 70-day period: \n25%,40%,55%,75%, and 100%. NRC staff asked if \nTVA plans to perform a Safe Shutdown test. TVA responded that they have no plan to perform a \nSafe Shutdown test. \nMr. Joe McCarthy of TVA described the regulatory status of the license amendments and relief \nrequests. He stated that TVA identified \n21 amendments that need to be completed prior to \nrestart. Mr. McCarthy stated that \nTVA has submitted 16 amendments to date. He explained that \n2 submittals are pending NRC issuance of topical report safety evaluations. Mr. McCarthy stated \nthat 4 amendments have been approved by the NRC. He explained that 6 amendments are on­\nhold pending resolution \nof the Method 3 Setpoint Methodology. Mr. McCarthy stated that 5 reliefs \nrequests were submitted and approved by the NRC. He explained that a risk-informed in-service \ninspection relief request is to be submitted for post-restart implementation. Mr. McCarthy stated \nthat \nTVA identified 82 programmatic submittals; he explained that 29 have been submitted to \ndate, 3 have been approved by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), and 9 have been \nclosed by Inspection Reports. \n\nMr. Brian O'Grady of TVA described the Browns Ferry site staffing plan. He stated that TVA used \nOconee and Palo Verde as a benchmark. Mr. O'Grady stated that there will be a 30% increase in \nstaff \nat Browns Ferry. NRC asked about Operator Licensing at the three units. TVA responded \nthat the Operators will be licensed for all three units. NRC asked about the simulators at Browns \nFerry. TVA responded that they have two simulators and one simulator will replicate Browns \nFerry Unit 1,   which TVA will start using in  August 2005. \nMr. Tom McGrath of TVA described the three programs that will address operational readiness: \nphysical; people; and self-assessments and independent reviews. He explained that TVA will \nperform line self-assessments, site departmental readiness assessments, Quality Assurance \nassessments, nuclear safety review board reviews, Institute of Nuclear Power Operations \nassessment planned for Summer 2006, and independent operational readiness review. Mr. \nMcGrath stated that the operational readiness will be essentially complete by Unit 1 fuel load \nexcept for specific post fuel load and power ascension testing activities. NRC asked if TVA can \nsupport license renewal inspection activities and TVA responded that they can. \nMr.  Raul Baron of TVA explained the focus areas for Quality Assurance: welding, procedure \nchange control, material control, coatings, fire protection, electrical installations, piping, pipe \nsupports, control of work, and human performance. NRC asked about a violation in the area of \npiping supports. TVA stated that they have made process changes to prevent a recurrence. NRC \nasked about the type of employee concerns being raised. TVA stated that the employee \nconcerns program have been raised \nin the following areas: painting in the torus, welding, \ncoatings, and labor-relations. TVA stated that they have problems with labor-relations. \nMr. Couch $tated that \nTVA has done this work twice before for Units 2 and 3 and have \nincorporated lessons learned from Units 2 and 3 into Unit 1. NRC asked about the TVA \nstatement of Unit 1 being operationally the same a Units 2 and 3 and yet Unit 1 will be better that \nUnits 2 and \n3. TVA stated that Unit 1 will have an operational margin better than Units 2 and 3. \nTVA stated that the modifications are being performed on Unit 1 first, then those same \nmodifications will be performed on Units 2 and \n3. TVA stated that after the modifications that \nUnits 1, 2, and 3 will be operationally the same. \nNRC PRESENTATION \nDr. Travers presented the key messages: focus on safety in the ongoing review of restart \nactivities, work closely with TVA, maintain open communications, and addressing emergent \nissues. \nMr. Steve Cahill, Chief of the Reactor Projects Branch 6 in Region II,  stated that the initial \ninspections focused on Engineering Design Reviews, TVA Special Program scope and activities, \nand closure of NRC open items for \nUnit1 and now the inspection focus is shifting to address final \nclosure of TVA Special Programs and closure of NRC generic open items (NRC Bulletins, Generic \nLetters, etc.). Mr. Cahill stated that the \nNRC has determined that the criteria for transitioning the \nfollowing four cornerstones of safety have been met: Occupational Radiation Safety, Public \nRadiation Safety, Emergency Preparedness, and Physical Protection. He stated that the NRC \nsent TVA a letter dated December 29, 2004 (ADAMS Accession No. ML043650021) explaining \nthe Reactor Oversight Process cornerstone transition. Mr. Cahill stated that the NRC Unit 1 \nRecovery Issues List will be attached to the Region \nII July 20, 2005, meeting summary and will be \nmade public. \nHe stated that the NRC is going to establish a Browns Ferry Restart Oversight \nPanel and will continue to follow the Unit 1 Safety Conscious \nWork Environment. \n\nMr. Ed Hackett described the status of the restart plan. He stated that the regulatory framework \nhas been defined, an inspection framework is being established, and licensing actions are being \nworked. Mr. Hackett stated that the Unit 1 restart \nis scheduled for May 2007, the license renewal \napplication approval is scheduled for May 2006, and the extended power uprate approval is \nscheduled for May 2007. Mr. Hackett stated that challenges exist for MELLA \n+, Method 3 \nInstrument Setpoint Methodology, and restarVlarge transient testing. He explained the next steps: \nACRS visit and briefing on August 23 and September 21, establish a Restart Oversight Panel in \nOctober 2005, supply an informational SECY paper to the Commission \nin the Fall 2005, \ncompletion of license renewal review \nin May 2006, and completion of the extended power uprate \nreview in Spring 2007. \nTVA stated that they are paying attention to the fuel analysis methodology \nchallenge, they are working with the Nuclear Energy Institute to resolve the Method 3 Instrument \nSetpoint challenge, and \nTVA does not plan to perform large transient testing as stated in its April \n25, 2005, letter (ADAMS Accession No. ML051170244). \nMr. Bill Kane, Deputy Executive Director for Reactor and Preparedness Programs of the Office of \nthe Executive Director of Operations (EDO), provided closing remarks. Mr. Kane stated that \nBrowns Ferry Unit 1 restart has the attention of the EDO and the Commission. Mr. Kane \nemphasized early identification of issues. \nAFTER MEETING DISCUSSIONS \nNRC asked TVA about \nthe process that TVA will notify the NRC when they are ready to restart \nBrowns Ferry Unit 1. \nTVA stated that they plan to call the Region II Regional Administrator when \nthey are ready to restart Browns Ferry Unit 1 and do not plan to send a letter requesting approval. \n\nMEETING ATTENDEES\n \nREGARDING THE JULY \n20, 2005, PUBLIC MEETING\n \nFOR BROWNS FERRY UNIT 1 RESTART STATUS\n \nOrganization and Title \nBill Couch \nTVA, BFN Site Licensing Manager \nJoe Valente \nTVA, BFN Unit 1 Engineering Manager \nR.G.

The Special Programs that require completion prior to Unit 1 restart \nwere evaluated and designed for Extended Power Uprate and License Renewal \nrequirements which were applicable to each structure, system or component. \nSpecial Programs to be completed prior to Unit 1 restart: \n• Component and Piece Part Qualification \n• Configuration Management -  Design Baseline and Essential Calculations \n* \n• Containment Coatings \n• Electrical Issues \n• Environmental Qualification \n• Fire Protection -  Appendix R \n• Flexible Conduit \n• Fuse Program \n• Instrument Sensing Lines \n• Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) \n• Moderate Energy Line Break \n* \n• Restart Test \n• Seismic Design Program \n• -TVA has notified NRC that the Unit 1 program has been completed. \nSpecial Programs considered closed before the Unit 1 restart project started: \n• Heat Code Traceability \n• Secondary Containment Penetrations \n• Thinning of Pipe Walls (Bulletin 87-01) \n• Welding \n• Probabilistic Safety Assessment (Generic Letter 88-20) \nA summary of each special program that requires completion for Unit 1 restart is \nprovided below. \n\nCOMPONENT AND PIECE PART QUALIFICATION \nThe objectives \nof this program are to: \n•   Verify that previously environmentally qualified equipment was not degraded \non Unit 1 through the use \nof spare and replacement parts, and \n•  Have programs and practices in  place to ensure that previously seismically \nand environmentally qualified equipment, and any equipment qualified by \nother programs in this restart effort, will not be degraded in the future through \nthe use \nof spare and replacement items. \nTo accomplish these objectives for Unit 1, the following tasks will be performed for any \nEO equipment not replaced during Unit 1 recovery: \n•  Review \nof maintenance history to identify activities that included replacement \nof safety related components, \n•  For any replacement item that has not been qualified as part \nof the EQ \nProgram, an evaluation will be completed to determine qualification, \n•  Evaluation \nof inventoried commercial grade spare parts to assure their \nsubsequent use will not degrade previously qualified equipment, and \n•  Unit 1 procedures and processes will include all \nof the work developed as part \nof the Unit 2 and 3 restart efforts to ensure current and future qualification \nof \ncomponents and piece parts. \nCONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT -  DESIGN BASELINE AND ESSENTIAL \nCALCULATIONS \nThe Browns Ferry Design Baseline Verification Program (DBVP) was established with \nthe objective \nof reestablishing the plant design basis and to evaluate the plant \nconfiguration. This DBVP reestablishes the plant design basis. The system \nboundaries were selected by determining systems and portion \nof systems used to \nmitigate design basis events, as described \nin Chapter 14 of the Updated Final Safety \nAnalysis Report (UFSAR), provide for safe shutdown and any other safety related \nfunction. Design basis changes resulting from later programs such as extended power \nuprate, Generic Letter 89-10, 10 CFR 50.49 Environmental Qualification \nof Electrical \nEquipment and the license renewal program have been addressed under separate \nprograms. The DBVP evaluations ensure: \n1.  Plant configuration satisfies the design basis. \n2.  Configuration of systems and components within the scope \nof the DBVP is \nsupported by engineering analysis and documentation. \n-   2   ­\n\n3.  Plant configuration is in  conformance with TVA's licensing commitments. \nThis was accomplished by four major tasks, as follows: \n1.  Establish Design Basis Input \nThis task consisted \nof developing a series of key products, which ultimately formed \nthe design bases \nof the plant. These items are: \n•  Databases containing licensing commitments made throughout the life \nof the \nplant and design requirements necessary to achieve safe shutdown. \n•  Design Criteria Documents developed from the above database and input \nfrom senior engineers were used to establish the required configuration. \n•  A  Safe Shutdown Analysis (SSA) \nof the FSAR requirements for identification \nof accidents, abnormal operational transients, and special events from which \nthe plant must be able to achieve safe shutdown. \n•  Essential calculations needed to verify the adequacy \nof the design within the \nsafe shutdown boundary. \n•  Test requirements which verify system capability using Baseline Test \nRequirements Documents. \nMuch \nof the data gathered in the Unit 2 and 3 efforts was applicable to Unit 1 and, in \nfact, most \nof the products identified above were built largely by revising Unit 2 and 3 \ndocuments to be Unit \n1 specific. \n2.  Establish Configuration \nThis task was accomplished by implementing the following activities: \n•  Walkdown of systems within the DBVP boundary to verify functional \nconfiguration. Flow diagrams were evaluated and corrected as required \nbased on the walkdown results. Review \nof input from walkdowns for other \nprograms not related to DBVP, such as EO and Appendix R was used to \nverify the correctness of associated drawings. \n•  Verification of control/single line/elementary/schematic diagrams has been \npartially accomplished through a review \nof existing documents and \nwalkdowns. Where walkdowns were not performed, the diagrams were \nmodified via the Design Change Notice (DCN) process. Implementation \nof \nthe Unit 1 Restarte DCNs will provide configuration control prior to restart of \nUnit \n1. Final verification will be accomplished by the restart test program. \n-    3   ­\n\n•  Testing performed during the Restart Test Program to ensure specifications \nverify required functions. \n3.  Evaluate Configuration \nThis task consisted \nof the following activities: \n•  Develop as-built drawings based on field walkdowns. These are known as the \nConfiguration Control Drawings (CCD). Review \nof CCDs to ensure they \naccurately depicted system functions, and differences dispositioned. \n•  Review \nof Corrective Action Program documents to ensure adequate \ncorrective actions were taken. \n•  Evaluation of other programs to ensure the appropriate corrective actions are \nincorporated into the applicable DCNs from the programmatic reviews such \nas EO, Appendix \nR, and Generic Letter 89-10. This effort is not a part of the \nDBVP scope but is performed in  conjunction with \nit. \n•  Evaluation of unimplemented or partially implemented changes for \nsignificance with respect to design basis. \n•  Units 2/3 DCNs were used as a basis to formulate the scope \nof effort required \nto return Unit 1 to service. The Units 2/3 DCNs were used as a \nrepresentation of the current status \nof an operating BFN unit. It was the intent \nof the Unit 1 restart effort to make Unit 1 functionally identical to the operating \nunits so that they would have a common design basis. This effort is not a  part \nof the DSVP scope but is performed in conjunction with it. \n•  Evaluation \nof components to ensure they perform their design basis function. \n•  Evaluation of test specifications to ensure that tests adequately verify \nspecified characteristics. \n4.  Issue Design Output \nThis task included issuing the following documents: \n•  Configuration Control Drawings. \n•  Calculations. \nAs in Unit \n3, the DSVP for Unit 1 utilized a consolidated approach which was completed \nprior to restart. NRC was notified \nof the Unit 1 program completion on May 19, 2005. \n-    4   ­\n\nCONTAINMENT COATINGS \nThis program will establish the condition \nof the qualified protective coating on the \nsurfaces \nof the drywell and torus and quantify the amount of unqualified coatings on \nequipment or structures inside primary containment. \nThe presence \nof unqualified coatings is established through a combination of \nwalkdowns, testing and review of contracts, vendor manuals and work orders. All \napplicable coated equipment and structures will be evaluated. Existing coatings that do \nnot qualify must be either removed, reduced in film thickness to less than 3 mils \nor \naccounted for in  the Uncontrolled Coating Log. \nThe condition of qualified coatings inside primary containment is established through \nwalkdowns by qualified inspectors. The condition is recorded and unacceptable areas \nare repaired. \nTorus coatings below the immersion area were sandblasted to clean metal and a new \nqualified coating system applied. Torus coatings above the immersion area have been \nrepaired. \nELECTRICAL ISSUES \nThe Electrical Issues Program consists \nof seven individual programs. These programs \nare: \n• Cable Ampacity \n• Cable Installation \n• Cable Separation \n• Cable Splices \n• Flexible Conduit \n• Fuse Program \n• Thermal Overloads \nEach \nof these is described below. \nCable Ampacity \nIn 1986 an audit revealed inadequacies in TVA's electrical design standards, creating \nthe potential for undersizing \nof safety related cables at Browns Ferry. TVA developed a \nnew standard, \"Ampacity Tables for Auxiliary and Control Power Cables\", which \ncorrected all inadequacies. This standard addressed all ampacity requirements \nof \nAppendix R. TVA used this standard to determine the extent of non-conformance and \nto implement corrective action for any non-conformance on Units 2 and \n3. This \nprogram ultimately assured that cables at Browns Ferry Units 2 and 3 are not utilized \nabove their rated temperatures and will be capable \nof performing their intended safety \nfunctions under normal, abnormal and accident conditions. \n-   5   ­\n\nThe replacement of V4 (480V power cable) and V5 (4160V) cables on Units 2 and 3 \nwas minimized and the use \nof original cable maximized through sampling and statistical \nanalysis, aging analysis, and ampacity calculations utilizing tray loading profiles. \nAssumptions were made that Unit 1 cables included \nin trays containing primarily Unit 2 \nand/or Unit 3 cables will not be energized. Approximately 3500 V3 (120VAC or \n250VDC) cables were reviewed during Unit 2 restart, with none requiring ampacity \nevaluations. For Unit 1, the intent is to abandon in place all V4 and V5 cable installed in \ntray and install new cable end to end. V4 and V5 cables in  conduit will be evaluated \nand replaced, as determined by evaluation. Unit 1 cables previously evaluated in \nsupport \nof Units 2 and 3 restart will be excluded from these considerations. \nBased on the results of the Unit 2 evaluation, Unit 1 V3 cables will not be evaluated. \nCable Installation \nBased on concerns that had previously been identified at the Sequoyah Plant, TVA \nidentified several potential installation issues that would be evaluated on Unit 2 to \nassure the adequacy \nof cable installations. These included sidewall pressure, jamming, \npullbys, vertical conduit, cable bend radius and pulling cable through flexible conduit \nand condulets. Since the program established at Sequoyah demonstrated the \nadequacy \nof TVA installation practices in maintaining the integrity of cables during \ninstallation, it was used as a baseline for the Unit 2 evaluation. This evaluation included \nthe following activities: \n•  Comparison \nof the cable installation requirements at Browns Ferry with those \nthroughout the industry, including Sequoyah, during the period \nof Browns \nFerry's construction, \n•  Comparison \nof the safety-related cable and conduit materials used at \nSequoyah and Browns Ferry, and \n•  Plant walkdown inspections to assure the cable installation practices and \nquality \nof installed cables. \nThree additional issues were identified during the Unit 2  recovery effort. There were \nuse \nof conduits as pull points for large 600 volt cables, missing conduit bushings, and \nBrand Rex cables. The Unit 2 tests and inspections resulted in limited replacement and \nconcluded that Unit 2 was successfully enveloped by the Sequoyah program, with two \nexceptions; bend radius and vertical supports. These two installation issues were \nevaluated separately, largely found acceptable and limited corrective actions taken. \nThe Unit 3 program included a review \nof issues evaluated for Unit 2, application of \nlessons learned, confirmatory walkdowns in  lieu of the evaluation program identified \nabove, and focused evaluations based on Unit 2 results. The Unit 1 program will be the \nsame as the Unit 3 program. \n-    6   ­\n\nCable Separation \nCable separation problems were first identified in 1988 and TVA subsequently \nestablished a program to determine the extent \nof separation non-conformance, and to \ntake the necessary corrective action. Discrepancies were grouped \nin the following \ncategories: \n•  Non-divisional circuits associated with more than one safety division, \n•  Cables with an \nIE or IES suffix, or Q-List cables that were designated as \neither divisional \nor nondivisional and with questionable raceway routing, and \n•  Inaccuracies \nin cable and conduit schedules. \nFor Unit \n2, TVA first validated the cable and Conduit schedule, then identified \npopulations \nof cables with one of the above discrepancies. Cable separation criteria \nwere developed and the populations were evaluated against the criteria. Corrective \nactions were implemented as required. \nThe Unit 3 program applied lessons learned from the Unit 2 program in  the following \nmanner: \n•  Applied an integrated walkdown approach, \n•  Used Unit 2 programs which evaluated Units 1 and 3 cables, and \n•  Evaluations were performed concurrent with Q-List development. \nThe Unit 1 separation scope will be performed in accordance with the Unit 3 criteria and \nimplementation precedent. \nCable Splices \nBased on concerns about improper installation \nof heat-shrinkable tubing over electrical \nsplices and terminations, TVA initiated a program consisting \nof two elements: \n•  Revision \nof the General Construction Specification G -38 and standard \ndrawings to address installation problems. \n•  Walkdowns to identify and inspect all 1E cable splices and terminations \nlocated in  harsh environments. Splices which did not conform to standards \nwere replaced. \nFor Unit \n1, the scope of the splice program includes all 10 CFR 50.49 cables and all \nsafety related cables below flood elevation. These will be identified via the \nEQ program \nand walkdowns. The total cable population will be walked down to locate splices; all \nof \nwhich will be replaced. \n-    7   ­\n\nFlexible Conduit \nOriginal construction specifications at Browns Ferry did not adequately address the \nrequirements for minimum and maximum flexible conduit lengths to allow for thermal \nand seismic movement. The current Construction Specification, G-40, defines the \nminimum conduit length for accommodating thermal and seismic movement. \nFor Units 2 and 3 TVA inspected all flexible conduits attached to electrical equipment \ncovered by 10 CFR 50.49 to verify that the lengths \nof flexible conduit satisfy G-40 \nrequirements for accommodating thermal and seismic movement. Conduits not \nsatisfying G-40 were documented and technically justified as acceptable, or reworked to \nsatisfy requirements. For unit \n1, conduits will be inspected during the walkdown of 10 \nCFR 50.49 cables. The results will be documented and evaluated, with the disposition \ndocumented. \nFuse Program \nThe Browns Ferry fuse substitution list \nin place prior to Unit 2 recovery conflicted with \nthe fuse substitution list contained \nin the Design Standards revised just prior to the \nrecovery effort. Thus, there was insufficient evidence that installed fuses would provide \nadequate overload protection for Unit \n2. TVA's program to address this issue included \nthe following steps: \n1.  Revise the Browns Ferry fuse substitution program control document to reflect \nthe appropriate standard. \n2.  Perform calculations to the revised standards to specify and tabulate correct \nfuses for each application. \n3.  Perform walkdowns to determine and document installed fuses and compare with \ntabulations. \n4.  Resolve and document inadequate fuses based on comparison. \n5.  Replace fuse ratings on design drawings with fuse identifications. \nFor Unit \n1, the fuse tabulation will be developed from existing common Unit 1, Unit 2 \nand Unit 3 tabulations. Unit 1 fuses will not be included \nin the walkdown. Instead, DCNs \nwill be issued to identify required fuses and replace applicable Unit 1 fuses, as required, \nbased on calculations. \n-    8   ­\n\nThermal Overloads \nTVA identified the fact that design drawings for 480V \nac and 250V dc motor control \ncenters (MCC) did not specify thermal overload ratings for the heaters which provide \nelectrical protection for the motors. The Thermal Overload \n(TOl) Program for Units 2 \nand 3 consisted of the following activities: \n•  Developed criteria for sizing the \nTOl heaters for MCC circuits. \n•  Performed walkdowns of the MCCs to determine and document the installed \nTOl heater element sizes and nameplate data for each load. \n•  Prepared calculations using revised design standards (criteria) to specify the \nappropriate heaters for each application. \n•  Reconciled walkdowns with calculations. \n•  Replaced or adjusted improperly sized heater elements. \n•  Updated drawings to reflect current heater elements. \nThe Unit 1 program will use the same approach, utilizing existing Unit 2 and 3 \ncalculations and worksheets. All Unit 1 \nTOls will be replaced based on calculations. \nENVIRONMENTAL QUALIFICATION \nThe Code of Federal Regulations requires that equipment used to perform a necessary \nsafety function is capable \nof maintaining functional operability under all service \nconditions postulated to occur during its installed life for the time it is required to \noperate. \nTVA determined that there was a systematic lack of qualification \ndocumentation for a significant part of the required eqUipment. \nTVA also determined \nthat the significance of the problems and the programmatic nature \nof the root causes \nrequired not only a program that demonstrated compliance to 10 \nCR 50.49 for all \nrequired equipment, but the development \nof an EQ program infrastructure. \nTo demonstrate compliance, TVA committed to subjecting all equipment within the \nscope \nof 10 CFR 50.49 at BFN to new review, which was independent of previous EQ \nefforts. TVA will use the infrastructure developed \nfor the Units 2 and 3 restart efforts to \nperform these reviews for Unit \n1. The following items or actions will support this effort \nas well as the long-term qualification of equipment for Unit \n1: \n•  Existing EQ program procedures provide the basis for maintaining EQ over \nthe operating life \nof the plant. \n-    9   ­\n\n•  Consistent documentation requirements, including the list of all electrical \nequipment located \nin harsh environments and required to function after an \naccident, and the \nEO Documentation Package provide documented evidence \nof the qualification of equipment for its specific application and environment. \n•  Incorporation of \nEO maintenance elements into ongoing maintenance \nactivities for equipment. \n•  Training \nof EO personnel on specific EO related subjects. \nThe elements \nof the EO review effort for Unit 1 include the following: \n1.  The 50.49 List \nThis list will include electrical equipment located \nin harsh environments and \nrequired to function after \nan accident. This list is developed through the following \nsteps: \na.  A systems analysis to determine for each Design Basis Accident (DBA) \nthose equipment items (\"end devices\"), which must either operate or \"stay­\nas-is\", to ensure completion \nof a safety related function. \nb.  For each end-device, a review of drawings is conducted to identify those \nancillary devices and cables required \nto operate or maintain electrical \nintegrity to ensure completion \nof the end-device's safety related function. \nThe end-device and the items added by this review comprise the \nComponent Master List (CML). \nc.  The CML is reduced by performing a failure analysis which eliminates \nthose components whose failure would not prevent achievement \nof the \nrequired safety action. \nd.  The elimination of equipment from the list that is  located in a mild \nenvironment. \ne.  An evaluation to determine if any components on the CML are located in a \nharsh environment, but do not experience it when they are required to \nfunction, and thus can be eliminated. \n2.  The EO Documentation Packages (EODPs) \nTVA has a documented process, including a detailed checklist, to direct the \ncompletion \nof documented evidence of qualification of equipment for its specific \napplication and environment. A package will be developed for each Unit 1 \nequipment type. \n-10­\n\nThe package will include: \n• Items comprising the equipment type, \n• Checklist for evaluation of qualification, \n• Analysis and justification of qualification, \n• Qualification documents, \n• Field verification data, and \n• Qualification Maintenance Data sheets. \nThese packages will be subjected to a systematic verification process. \n3.  Collection \nof all data necessary to support EQ activities including design \ndrawings, purchase contracts, vendor information, test reports and field \nverification checklists. \n4.  Long-term support of equipment qualification via maintenance, training,\n \nwarehouse inventory \nI spare parts and modifications I installations.\n \nThe implementation \nof the Unit 1 EQ program will be performed in  accordance with the \nUnits 2 and 3 criteria and implementation precedents. \nFIRE PROTECTION -  APPENDIX R \nThe Fire Protection Improvement Program for Unit 2 included the following elements: \n•  Compliance to 10 CFR 50 Appendix \nR, and \n•  Plant Fire Protection Program, which addressed: \n-Organization and staffing \n-Fire protection procedures and administrative controls \n-Evaluation \nof compliance with regulatory and industry standards and \ncorrective actions to address deviations \nA report on improvements to the Browns Ferry Fire Protection Program to satisfy \nAppendix R requirements was submitted by TVA in  April 1988. The report contained \nthe \"Fire Protection Plan for the BFN\", the \"10 CFR 50 Appendix R Safe Shutdown \nAnalysis\", and the Fire Hazards Analysis for Fire Areas and Zones in  the BFN\". During \nthe restart effort, TVA proceeded with implementation of the modifications for \ncompliance, based on the submittal. The modifications included items in the following \nareas: \n•  Fire detection, \n•  Fire suppression, \n•  Compartmentation, \n•  Circuit \nmodi'fications, \n•  Cable modifications, \n-11­\n\n•  Breaker and fuse upgrades, \n•  Addition \nof main steam relief valve backup air supply, \n•  Battery backup power supply for communications, and \n•  Emergency lighting \nThe Unit 1 scope will focus on these evaluations and the modifications necessary to \ngain compliance with Appendix \nRand NFPA standards. The major tasks that make up \nthis scope are: \n•  Preparation of a Fire Hazards Analysis for Unit \n1, \n•  Preparation of a Unit 1 Baseline Appendix R Analysis, \n•  Performing modifications necessary to be in compliance with regulations and \nstandards, \n•  Preparation \nof Safe Shutdown procedures utilizing existing procedures \nalready in-place for Units 2 and \n3, and \n•  Preparation \nof a Site Fire Protection Report to include Unit 1. \nThe intent of these activities is to achieve compliance with Appendix R while \nmaintaining commonality between the units. \nINTERGRANULAR STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (IGSCC) \nThe objective \nof the IGSCC Program is  to address all of the instances of Intergranular \nStress Corrosion Cracking with long term resolutions. The scope \nof IGSCC susceptible \npiping and components was established by the guidelines of GL 88-01 and includes: \n•  Reactor Recirculation from the recirculation inlet and outlet nozzles to the \nconnections with residual heat removal, \n•  Residual Heat Removal (RHR) from the recirculation system to the first \nisolation valve outside of the drywell penetration, \n•  Reactor Water Cleanup (RWCU) from its connection to the RHR system to \nfirst isolation valve outside \nof the drywell penetration, \n•  Core Spray from the core spray inlet nozzles to the drywell penetration, \nincluding the core spray inlet safe ends, \n•  Recirculation Inlet Safe Ends, and \n•  Jet Pump Instrumentation Safe Ends. \n-12­\n\nThe head spray systems are not included, because they will be removed from Unit 1 \nbefore plant startup. The Unit 1 program is implementing the following mitigating \nactions: \n•  Full replacement \nof all IGSCC susceptible piping, safe ends and penetrations \nwith resistant material, \n•  Stress improvements applied to new weldments, and \n•  Implementation \nof hydrogen water chemistry \nAdditionally, \nTVA has already replaced all jet pump beams on Unit 1 and will inspect \nshroud head bolts, which have shown evidence of cracking at Browns Ferry and other \nBWRs, and replace them, as required. \nINSTRUMENT SENSING LINES \nThe program to qualify Unit 2 and common instrument sensing lines was developed to \naddress concerns with regard to slope, physical separation and quality classification \nrelating \nto material control. The Unit 2 approach involved scoping out instruments and \ntheir associated sensing lines based \non System Requirements Calculations, FSAR \nChapter 14, Emergency Operating Instructions, equipment related parameters and \nmaintenance history. Safety significance and equipment vulnerability screening criteria \nwere developed using this information. The lines selected based on these criteria were \nwalked down and evaluated using established acceptance criteria. Lines not satisfying \nthese criteria were evaluated via calculations, and those not qualifying were modified. \nReviews and assessments identified no specific cases \nof inadequate physical \nseparation and this was supported by all Unit 2 reviews performed. Additionally, there \nwere no specific cases of inadequate quality classification identified and the reviews \nsupported this as well. Based on these results and on the review \nof physical plant, \ncriteria documents and design specifications for Unit \n3, the Unit 3 program reviewed \ninstrument sensing lines only for slope problems. The Unit 1 restart program will use \nthe same approach. \nMODERATE ENERGY LINE BREAK \nModerate Energy Line Breaks (MELB) are those breaks in liquid systems that are not \nhigh energy lines, but if they break could cause damage to safety related structures, \nsystems \nor components due to the effects of flooding. A MELB evaluation has been \nperformed for Unit 1 using the same methodology used for the Units 2 and 3 MELB \nevaluations. The Unit 1 MELB evaluation also considered design changes made \nfor the \nplanned Extended Power Uprate. The conclusions \nof the MELB evaluation were that \n-13­\n\nBFN Unit 1 conforms to the original licensing basis and the existing flooding studies and \nprotective measures are adequate. \nTVA notified NRC on June 25,2004, that the Unit 1 MELB program had been \ncompleted. \nRESTART TEST \nThe Restart Test Program is conducted to ensure that plant systems are capable \nof \nmeeting their safe shutdown requirements. The elements of the program are: \n1.  Review of documentation relating to operating, maintenance and modification \nhistory, as well as vendor recommendations to provide key input to development \nof system test requirements. \n2.  Development \nof baseline test requirements (BTRDs) for each required plant \nsystem to define scope \nof testing required, identify additional testing \nrequirements beyond routine testing, and to identify requirements for tracking \ntesting and evaluating test results. \n3.  Development of Test Instructions for each required system to identify specific \ntesting to verify system performance consistent with specification requirements, \nand to track and verify completion \nof each test and evaluate results. These \ninstructions, as well as the specifications, will work within the framework \nof \nexisting procedures. \nFor Unit \n1, administrative controls will be used to ensure that the status of operating \nunits is considered during planning and scheduling \nof restart tests, as was done for the \nUnit 3 restart tests. \nSEISMIC DESIGN PROGRAM \nTwo \nof the issues that comprise the seismic design program were closed for all three \nBFN units as part \nof the Unit 2 restart effort. These were secondary containment \npenetrations, whose physical work was completed due to its common nature, and \nmiscellaneous civil issue, which was combined with other programs. The remaining \nprograms that must be completed to support Unit 1 restart are: \n1.  Torus Modifications includes a re-inspection of torus attached piping and \nmodifications to torus and torus internal structural components to verify that \ndesign drawings reflect the as-installed configuration. Discrepant items are \nidentified, evaluated, and modifications performed as required. \n-14­\n\n2.  Large Bore Piping and Supports (Bulletins 79-02 and79-14) involves completing \nthe verification \nof as-built versus as-designed piping and supports. It includes \nfield walkdowns \nof existing piping configurations, analysis to the current design \ncriteria, and the required modifications to existing piping and supports to \nestablish compliance with the design criteria. \n3.  Cable Tray, Conduit Supports, and the Seismic \nII Over II Water Spray programs \naddress seismic qualification \nof the supports using the Generic Implementation \nProcedure developed by the Seismic Qualification Utility Group (SQUG). \n4.  HVAC Ductwork involves inspection \nof ductwork for attributes important to \nseismic qualification and analyzing them against design criteria to ensure as-built \nversus as-designed discrepancies are reconciled. \n5.  Small Bore Piping and Instrument Tubing programs are reqUired to address \nconcerns about design criteria, incomplete support details and missing \ncalculations for piping, and the need to consider thermal stresses for tubing. The \nresolution methodology for both piping and tubing on Units 2  and 3 included \nidentifying generic attributes, performing rigorous analysis \nof 10 - 15% of the \npiping within the safe shutdown boundary to verify the attributes, and performing \nwalkdowns based on these attributes. Outliers were identified, evaluated and \nmodified when design criteria were not met. The criteria and implementation \nprecedent used for Unit 3 will be used for Unit \n1. \n6.  Control Bod Drive (CBD) Hydraulic Piping program addresses a concern raised \nabout the adequacy \nof CRD insert and withdrawal piping and piping supports to \ncarry design basis loads. Units 2 and 3 tUbing were qualified via conservative \nbounding calculations to current design criteria, supported by confirmatory \nevaluations. Unit 1 tubing are being qualified using the same bounding \ncalculations. \n7.  Drywell Steel Platform - Concerns addressed by this program were: \n• As-built versus as-designed discrepancies, \n• Structural behavior not completely evaluated \nor documented, and \n• Steel had not been evaluated for loads added since original design. \nThe Unit 1 drywell program will use the methodology and design criteria \ndeveloped for Units 2 and \n3. \n8.  Miscellaneous Steel program addresses configuration problems on \nmiscellaneous framing installed throughout the Reactor Building during \nconstruction. The framing supports large bore piping and other commodities. \nThe Unit 1 program will utilize the same design criteria, methodology and \nanalysis tools used on Units 2 and \n3. \n-15­\n\nADAMS DOCUMENT PROFILE \nFOR SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING MINUTES \n[Required fields in red] \nOriginator: I JGL1 \nDocument Properties: \nValue: \nItem ID: \nAccession Number: \nEstimated Page Count: \n......

Meserve\nChairman\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nWashington, D.C. 20555-0001\nDear Chairman Meserve:\nSUBJECT:NRC PROGRAM FOR RISK-BASED ANALYSIS OF REACTOR OPERATING\nEXPERIENCE\nDuring the 471st meeting of the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, April 5-7, 2000,\nwe met with representatives of the NRC staff to discuss the NRC program for risk-based\nanalysis of reactor operating experience. The staff presented an overview of the key elements\nof this program, including data sources, reliability studies, common-cause failure analyses,\naccident sequence precursor analyses, and risk-based performance indicators.  Our\nSubcommittee on Reliability and Probabilistic Risk Assessment met on December 15, 1999, to\ndiscuss these matters.\nConclusions and Recommendations\n1 .The NRC program for risk-based analysis of reactor operating experience is\nappropriately focused on current and future needs of the Agency. This program is\nessential to validate system reliability analysis models and predictions, and is of critical\nimportance for the successful transition to risk-informed regulation.  This program\nshould be assigned high priority and adequate resources to effectively support the\ntransition to risk-informed regulation.\n2.The staff should work with the industry to ensure that licensee reporting of reliability data\nfor structures, systems, and components (SSCs) that perform risk-significant functions\nbecomes an industry self-imposed requirement of the Equipment Performance and\nInformation Exchange System (EPIX) Program.\n3.The staff should perform a systematic evaluation of the equipment reliability and\navailability databases it needs to support risk-informed regulation.\n4.The staff should develop a White Paper or other regulatory guidance to provide\nmathematical definitions for risk-analysis terms, such as availability and reliability, and to\nprovide guidance on the specific raw data that need to be collected to properly estimate\nsuch terms.\n\n2\n5.The staff should perform a systematic comparison of the Standardized Plant Analysis\nRisk (SPAR) models with the licensees’ probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs) or\nindividual plant examinations (IPEs) to identify potential differences in modeling and\nresults, understand the reasons for the differences, and use these insights to improve\nthe SPAR models and tools for the inspection staff.  A peer review of the SPAR models\nshould also be considered.\nDiscussion\nThe NRC program for risk-based analysis of reactor operating experience includes the\ncollection of industry data, estimation of reliability and availability parameters, industry-wide\nassessment and trending of systems and components reliability, study of common-cause failure\nanalyses, accident sequence precursor analyses, and development of SPAR models for use by\nthe NRC in risk-informed regulation.  Each element of this program has clearly identified users,\nand in the case of SPAR, a SPAR Model Users Group. This program and its elements are\nappropriately focused on current and future needs of the Agency.  The products generated by\nthis program provide essential information and support to important NRC functions and\ninitiatives.\nThis program is essential to validate system reliability analysis models and predictions and is of\ncritical importance for the successful transition to risk-informed regulation.  The availability of an\nimproved and expanded database grounded on operating experience will allow the staff to\nbetter estimate reliability and availability parameters to trend industry performance. The\nanalysis of this database is essential for the identification and industry-wide trending of\ncommon-cause failures and accident sequence precursors, the validation of risk assessment\ntools and their predictions, and the development of an improved and expanded set of revised\nreactor oversight process performance indicators and plant-specific thresholds.  The need for\ncareful review and analysis of the expanding database and for the prompt development,\nrefinement, and maintenance of analysis tools, such as SPAR models, to support plant-specific\nrisk evaluations and the risk-informed oversight process may require more resources than are\ncurrently allocated to this program.\nApproximately 47,000 licensee event reports (LERs) submitted since 1981 constitute the\noperating experience database developed and maintained by the NRC and accessed through\nthe Sequence Coding and Search System (SCSS). The nature of the events requiring an LER\ntends to restrict the type of data to failures that fit certain regulatory reporting requirements. For\nexample, failure of a component in a redundant train of a safety-related system is sometimes\nnot reportable through an LER. Therefore, the LERs do not provide a complete failure rate\ndatabase.  To correct this situation and to expand the database available to the NRC to include,\nfor example, failure rates of components identified as risk significant for the maintenance rule,\nthe Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) has agreed to make accessible to the NRC\nthe EPIX Program that was developed by the industry to support maintenance rule\nimplementation.  The industry has agreed to modify EPIX to provide the reliability and\navailability data requested by the staff.  Furthermore, the industry has agreed to make EPIX the\nindustry's single, common database to support all industry uses, thereby eliminating the several\n\n3\ncollection systems previously in place to support specific industry applications and regulatory\nrequirements.\nThese actions represent significant progress in the development of a common industry and\nNRC operating experience database.  We are concerned, however, that licensee reporting of\ncertain reliability and availability data into EPIX remains voluntary even for key components that\nperform risk-significant functions.  Inconsistent, selective reporting will invalidate the database\nand make its use in regulatory applications limited.  The staff should address this concern with\nthe industry to ensure that licensee reporting of reliability and availability data for components\nthat perform risk-significant functions becomes an industry self-imposed requirement of the\nEPIX Program.\nThrough the years, the industry has responded to new regulatory requirements or industry\ninitiatives to collect reliability and availability information by establishing\nad hoccollection\nprocesses tailored to the specific uses of the information being collected.  This approach has\nresulted in the proliferation of definitions of terms such as availability and reliability that are not\nalways consistent with their use in PRA.  Now that the decision has been made to utilize EPIX\nas the industry's single, common database to support all industry applications and regulatory\nrequirements, it is essential to establish common definitions for these terms so that the\nappropriate data from which these terms are estimated will be collected.  The staff should\ndevelop a White Paper or other regulatory guidance (e.g., an Information Notice) that will\nprovide proper definitions of these terms and examples of how they are to be estimated from\ndata and will discuss how they differ from the definitions currently used by the industry to fulfill\nspecific regulatory requirements or industry initiatives.\nThe development of SPAR models is a significant initiative intended to provide the staff,\nincluding the regions and resident inspectors, with the tools necessary to support the\nsignificance determination process and to perform independent evaluations of events and\nproposed plant changes. The SPAR models are internal events models of each U.S. operating\nplant and model the plants down to the system or major component level, but do not model\ndown to the subcomponent and support system level. These analyses have been compared\nwith existing plant-specific PRAs or IPEs in only a few cases.  Given the inherent limitations of\nthe SPAR models, they should undergo a systematic comparison with all IPEs in order to\nunderstand differences in modeling and results.  Such comparison will help resolve modeling\ndifferences, identify additional systems and components that need to be included in the model,\nidentify significant omissions and errors, and develop a better understanding of IPE models.  To\nachieve this resolution, it may be necessary for the staff to examine the licensees’ fault trees as\nwell as the IPEs.\nThe user-driven initiatives to verify, validate, and improve the SPAR models to support\nrisk-informed evaluations will make the SPAR models increasingly capable and important in\nregulatory actions and evaluations.  A peer review of the SPAR models should be considered.\nThe staff is planning to use the substantial availability and reliability information made available\nthrough EPIX to develop improved, risk-based performance indicators (RBPIs).  The staff plans\nto identify RBPIs for low-power and shutdown operations and for external events, to expand the\ncurrent set of performance indicators to include unavailability indicators for risk-significant\nSSCs, to identify plant-specific thresholds, and to provide a consistent framework for combining\n\n4\nthe risk significance of performance indicators and inspection findings to determine the risk\nsignificance of overall plant performance. This RBPI plan is documented in an overview White\nPaper currently under review by the ACRS.  This work addresses the concerns of some ACRS\nmembers and other stakeholders with the current set of performance indicators.  We plan to\nreview this very important work.  The successful implementation of this plan depends on the\nsoundness of the EPIX database, which in turn, depends on the industry's commitment to\nconsistently report the required reliability and availability data into the EPIX Program.\nSincerely,\n/RA/\nDana A.

After \nthe reactor internals \nhave been\nsubjected to the significant flo,-' \nmodes\nexpected during service \nlifetme under\nnormal reactor \noperatior, and other\nmodes of reactor operation, visual \nand\nnondestructive \nsurface examinations \nof\nreactor internals should be conducted \nto\ndetect \nany evidence of the effects \nof\nvibrations. \nThese examinations should be\nconducted preferably \nfollowing removal\nof the \ninternals from the reactor vessel.\nWhere removal is not \nfeasible, the\nexaminations should \nbe performed by\nmeans of examination \nequipment\nappropriate \nfor in situ examination. The\nareas examined should \ninclude all major\n2 \nFrequency'and \namplitudes \nof \nvibration, \nin \nterms \nof\nvelocities, accelerations and displacements \nor strains.\n4\n20.2\n\nload-bearing :elements ' of the' \nreactor\ninternalswhich \nare relied upon \nto retain\nthe! core structure \nin place, the \nlateral,\nvertical, \nand \ntorsional \n-restraints \nprovided\nwithin the reactor vessel, \nthose locking\nand \nbolting devices whose \nfailure could\nadversely affect \nthe structural integrity \nof\nthe internals, and those \ncritical locations\no-n \n' reactor internal components \nas\nidentified \nfrom the vibration \nanalyses.\n5.\nIn \nthe event either the \ninspections of\nreactor \ninternals reveal unacceptable\ndefects \nor the results of the \nvibration test\nprogram \nfail to meet the \nspecified\nacceptance \ncriteria, a report should \nbe\nprepared \nand submitted \nto the\nCommission \nfor review, which \nincludes an\nevaluation and a \ndescription of the\ncorrective, \nactions planned \nin order to\njustify the adequacy \nof the reactor\ninternals \ndesign to withstand the\nvibrations expected \nin service.\n6. If the test and examination program is\nacceptable, \na summary \nof the results\nobtained \nfrom the vibration \ntests and\ninspection \nshould be submitted \nto the\nCommission after \ncompletion of the tests.\nThe summary \nshould include:\na. a description \nof any differences \nfrom\nthe specified vibration \ntests program,\ninstrumentation reading \nanomalies and\ninstrument failures.\nb. a comparision \nbetween the \nmeasured\nvalues \nof vibration responses \nincluding\nthe \nparameters\n3  \nfrom \nwhich input\nforcing \nfunctions are determined \nand\nthe predi*cted \nvalues from the analysis.\nThis comparison \nshould be made for\nthose components \nof the reactor\ninternals for \nwhich the acceptance\ncriteria \nunder C.l.f. have \nbeen\nestablished with \nrespect to the\ndifferent \nmodes of \nvibration,\nc. an \nevaluation of measurements \nthat\nexceeded acceptable \nlimits or of\nobservations \nthat were unanticipated,\nand the disposition of such deviations.\n'Where \nmleasurements to determine \nforcing\nfunctions cannot \nbe obtained practically \nin all areas by\nmeans \nof pressure transducers (or \nother instruments).\nsuch values may be estimated \nfrom measured responses\nand from \nanalytical and empirical \nresults.\nD. Regulatory Position \nfor Reactor Internals\nSimilar \nto the \nPrototype \nDesign\n-1. The reactor internals \nimportant to safety\nshould be \nsubjected during \nthe\npreoperational functional \ntesting program\nto all significant flow \nmodes of normal\nreactor \noperation and under \nthe same test\nconditions \nimposed on the \nprototype\ndesign whose \nvibration analysis and \ntests\nhave been accepted \nand approved.\nThe test \nduration should be \nat least as\nlong as that \nconducted on the prototype\ndesign.\n2. Following \ncompletion of \nthe\npreoperational \nfunctional \ntests, the\nreactor \ninternals should be removed \nfrom\nthe reactor \nvessel and visual \nand\nnondestructive \nexamination \nof the reactor\ninternals \nshould be conducted. \nThe areas\nexamined should \ninclude:\na. \nall major load bearing \nelements of the\nreactor internals relied \nupon to retain\nthe core structure \nin place,\nb. \nthe lateral, vertical, \nand torsional\nrestraints provided within \nthe vessel,\nc. those locking and \nbolting devices\nwhose \nfailure could adversely \naffect\nthe structural \nintegrity of the \ninternals,\nd. those other \nlocations on the reactor\ninternal \ncomponents which \nwere\nexamined on the \nprototype design,\ne. the interior \nof the reactor \nvessel for\nevidence \nof \nloose \nparts \nor foreign\nmaterial.\n3. In \nlieu of \nthe visual \nand surface\nexaminations of the removed reactor\ninternals \nof 2. above, a vibration \ntest\nprogram may \nbe implemented \nduring the\npreoperational \nfunctional \ntesting \nprogram\nby \nusing sufficient \nand appropriate\nvibration-measuring \ninstrumentation \nto\ndetect \nthe \npredominant \nvibratory\nresponses \nobserved in the \napproved and\naccepted prototype design.\nThe predominant vibratory responses\nto \nbe measured \nshould \nbe those \nwhich,\nfrom the results of the prototype \ntest,\nidentify the principal characteristics and\nmodes \nof vibration \nof the \nreactor \ninternal\n20.3\n\ncomponents, \nand \nwhich \nwill permit\ncomparison \nof measured \nresponses \nto\nconfirm the substantially similar\nvibrational \nbehavior, \nbetween \nthe \ntested\ninternals \nand \nits prototype \nunit, within\nthe limits of the test acceptance criteria of\nthe prototype \ndesign.\nIn the event \nsignificant dissimilarity \nof\nresponses \nare obsered \nfor specific\ncomponents, \nvisual examinations \nshould\nbe \nperformed of \nthese components \nby\nmeans \nof appropriate \nexamination\nequipment \nwhich \npermits \ninsitu\ninspection. \nIn all cases, \nthe interior of the\nreactor \nvessel should \nbe \nvisually \nchecked\nfor evidence \nof loose parts \nand foreign\nmaterial.\n4.

These combined plans constitute Monticello and Prairie \nIsland’s Emergency Response Plan. NSPM is a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Corporation \nand operates Monticello and Prairie Island Nuclear Power Sites. As asset owner Xcel \nEnergy retains all owner obligations. \n1.2 In support of the planning effort at these fixed nuclear facilities, supplemental \nemergency response plans have been developed by organizations outside of and \nwithin the NSPM/Xcel Energy. These include response plans developed by the States \nof Minnesota, Wisconsin (a state contiguous to NSPM/Xcel Energy Prairie Island site) \nand Prairie Island Indian Community. Response plans have also been developed by \ncounties (in both states) which are within the emergency planning zones at either \nMonticello or Prairie Island Nuclear Generating plants. Response arrangements have \nbeen developed with various service oriented organizations in support of both sites.  \nThese include such entities as hospitals, ambulance services, federal radiological \nemergency response teams, contractor laboratories, vendors and consultants. These \narrangements are documented in a list of \"letters of agreement\" attached in Attachment \n5 to this plan.  \nNSPM/Xcel Energy Chief Nuclear Officer is ultimately responsible for ensuring a well \nprepared and adequately staffed Emergency Response Organization (ERO) is in place \nfor both the On-site and Off-site organizations. NSPM/Xcel Energy’s Chief Nuclear \nOfficer ensures this by requiring strict compliance to the Emergency Plans. This plan \ncan be implemented in response to emergencies at either Monticello or Prairie Island \nnuclear facilities.  It coordinates the resources of the NSPM/Xcel Energy and other \nsupporting departments.  The emergency response planning effort consists of three \nphases:  \n1.   The Response \n2.   Offsite Assistance \n3.   The Recovery \nThe Response Phase is that period of time immediately following the classification of \nan emergency condition.  Responses during this phase are those actions which are \ntaken by site personnel to reduce consequences of the emergency condition. Each site \nplan directs actions during this period and is designed to interface with other response \nplans if it becomes necessary to utilize outside assistance. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 4 of 56 \n \n \nThe Offsite Assistance Phase commences when organizations other than the affected \nsites are used to assist the site in response to the emergency. The response effort \ndescribed in this Plan is designed for the Offsite Assistance Phase. The Monticello and \nPrairie Island Offsite Nuclear Emergency Plan organizes the total resources of the \nNSPM/Xcel Energy to facilitate support of the affected site. Activation of the Monticello \nand Prairie Island Offsite Response Organization (ORO) including state, federal, and \nlocal governmental response organizations are associated with this phase. \nThe Recovery Phase commences when the Emergency Director, Emergency Manager, \nPlant Manager, and the Recovery Manager agree that all Emergency Organization \nactivities in progress can be safely transferred to the Recovery Organization, and a \npunch list of short-term and long-term projects have been identified and prioritized, and \nconsultation has occurred with the NRC. The methodology for the transition to the \nRecovery Phase is specified in the site Emergency Plan Implementing Procedures.   \n2.0   APPLICABILITY \n2.1 This plan can be implemented in response to an emergency at either Monticello or \nPrairie Island Nuclear Generating Plants.  \n3.0   RESPONSIBILITIES \nMonticello and Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plants will activate their respective \nemergency organization independent of offsite assistance. The site staff is responsible \nfor taking the immediate actions to mitigate the emergency and limit the adverse \neffects. The time taken to completely activate the Monticello or Prairie Island \nEmergency Response Organization will not adversely affect the site's response to the \nemergency condition.  \nThe Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Emergency Response Organization is shown \nin  Attachment 1. Methods are established in procedures to ensure that the necessary \npersonnel are available to staff required positions or that alternates are specified.  \nThe following is a description of key members of the Monticello and Prairie Island \nOffsite Emergency Response Organization. The site emergency organizations are \ndescribed in the site plans. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 5 of 56 \n \n \n3.1 Responsibilities of NSPM/Xcel Energy’s Offsite Emergency Response \nOrganization Positions \n3.1.1 Xcel Energy Communications \nThis group is represented by the Xcel Energy Communications staff.

However, it is the \npurpose of the Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Nuclear Emergency Plan to \naugment the Onsite Emergency Response Organization with additional resources as \nsoon as possible. The Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Nuclear Emergency Plan is \ndesigned to be implemented in an incremental manner, as site needs dictate. For \nemergency conditions that are classified as Unusual Events, the response will be \nlimited to supplying offsite assistance in the areas of public information (Xcel Energy’s \nCommunications Department) and liaison to state and local officials.  During an “Alert”, \n“Site Area Emergency”, or “General Emergency” NSPM/Xcel Energy Monticello and \nPrairie Island Offsite Emergency Response Organization will be activated.  This \nactivation will be accomplished through use of the automated Emergency Response \nOrganization Notification System (ERONS) which is initiated by the site.  \nThe individuals assigned to the Offsite Emergency Response Organization as well as \ntheir duties and responsibilities are identified in the Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite \nNuclear Emergency Plan Implementing Procedures.   \nThe Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Nuclear Emergency Plan coordinates the \nresources of several utility, NSPM/Xcel Energy departments and various outside \nagencies.  These organizations have each developed emergency planning documents \nto support their respective functions in the event of a nuclear incident at Monticello or \nPrairie Island nuclear sites. The Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Nuclear \nEmergency Plan is implemented depending on the severity and location of the incident, \nin conjunction with one or more of the following emergency plans: \n1.   Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant Emergency Plan.   \n2.   Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Emergency Plan.   \n3.   State of Wisconsin Emergency Response Plan (applicable for PI Site only)   \n4.   Pierce County Emergency Operations Plan (applicable for PI Site only).  \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 12 of 56 \n \n \n5.   State of Minnesota Emergency Operations Plan. \n6.   State of Minnesota Local Government Emergency Response Plans for Nuclear \nGenerating Plants. \n   City of Red Wing/Goodhue County Emergency Response Plan for the Prairie \nIsland Nuclear Generating Plant.   \n   Dakota County Emergency Response Plan for an Incident at the Prairie Island \nNuclear Generating Plant.   \n   Wright County Emergency Response Plan for the Monticello Nuclear \nGenerating Plant.   \n   Sherburne County Emergency Response Plan for the Monticello Nuclear \nGenerating Plant. \n7.   Prairie Island Indian Community (applicable for PI Site only). \nAdditionally, \"Letters of Agreement\" have been obtained from various other offsite \nagencies and corporations.  These letters specify pre-existing arrangements to support \nNSPM/Xcel Energy or state and local government actions during an emergency \ncondition. A list of these letters is provided in Attachment 5 of this Plan.  \n5.2 Emergency Classification System  \nAt the Monticello and Prairie Island Nuclear Generating facilities, emergencies are \nclassified into one of four categories. Each succeeding category increases in level of \nseverity and requires an increased amount of participation by onsite and offsite \npersonnel. For each emergency category, key personnel within NSPM/Xcel, Federal, \nState, Tribal and local organizations will be notified.  They will, in turn, activate their \nrespective emergency organizations according to their individual plans based on the \nconditions of the emergency. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 13 of 56 \n \n \nEach classification provides a known boundary concerning the severity of the \nemergency condition. All NSPM/Xcel, Federal, State and local organizations accept \nthis classification system and recognize the bounds of severity of the categories. \nAssociated with this classification system are recommended guidelines for protective \nactions to be implemented by State and local offsite authorities.  Various events could \ninitially be classified in one category and later be reclassified, as better defined and \nmore complete information becomes available. The emergency classification system is \nconstructed to provide a smooth transition between categories. The mechanism to \nclassify any single event or group of events or conditions into one of the above \ncategories is contained in the respective Site Emergency Plan Implementing \nProcedures. In general, the individual who is functioning as the Emergency Director is \nresponsible to classify all emergency conditions.  In certain situations it is possible that \nthe offsite organization may have data which would confirm an emergency \nclassification or precipitate a reclassification. In order to preclude erroneous \nreclassification, after the EOF Emergency Response Organization is fully activated and \nhas assumed responsibility for offsite activities, all changes in classification must have \nthe concurrence of the Emergency Manager. \nMonticello and Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Emergency Plan Implementing \nProcedures contain specific parameter values and equipment status for each \nemergency class as a convenient cross reference. \n5.2.1 Classification System  \nEmergency situations are classified according to severity, taking into consideration \npotential as well as actual events in process.  The four classifications are as follows: \n1.   Notification of Unusual Event (Unusual Event) \n2.   Alert \n3.   Site Area Emergency \n4.   General Emergency \nMethodologies for Classification of Emergencies are found in the Site Emergency \nPlans. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 14 of 56 \n \n \n5.3 Facilities and Equipment \n5.3.1 Description of NSPM/Xcel Energy’s Offsite Facilities \n1.   Backup Emergency Operations Facility (BUEOF) \nThis facility is approximately 1400 sq. ft. in area and is located in conjunction with \nXcel Energy’s general offices in Minneapolis. The primary purpose of this facility \nis to serve as the Backup EOF in the event that the near site EOF becomes \nuninhabitable or security issues exist. \n2.   Near-site Emergency Operations Facility (EOF) \nThe Emergency Operations Facility is activated during \"Alert\", \"Site Area \nEmergency\" and \"General Emergency\" conditions.  The purpose of the EOF is to \nprovide a command and control center for the utilities offsite emergency activities \nconcerned with identifying and limiting the consequences of the emergency \nconditions.  The EOF is located in the Plant Training Center which also contains \nadministrative offices for the Training Department and the plant simulator.  \nFor Monticello, the EOF is located approximately 1 mile south-southeast of the \nplant within the city of Monticello. For Prairie Island, the EOF is located \napproximately 1/2 mile west of the plant.  \nA more detailed description of the EOF facilities are contained in the Monticello \nand Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Emergency Plans. \n5.3.2 On-Site Plant Emergency Centers \nThere are two emergency centers at each plant, the onsite Technical Support Center \nand the onsite Operational Support Center.  Alternative Response Facilities have been \ndesignated when ERO response to the onsite centers is not appropriate due to the \nnature of the site event. Detailed descriptions of these centers are included in the \nspecific site plans. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 15 of 56 \n \n \n5.3.3 Governmental Facilities \n1.   Minnesota State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) \nThe State EOC is the command and control center for the state. Coordination will \nbe maintained between County EOCs and the State EOC for situation evaluation \nand protective actions. Federal agencies assigned responsibilities in the event of \na nuclear power plant accident, regardless of location, will maintain coordination \nwith the State EOC.  State agencies assigned responsibilities for emergency \nfunctions will provide required personnel at the State EOC. In most instances, \nwhen the state EOC is activated a licensee Executive Spokesperson will be in \nattendance. The Executive Spokesperson will have an office at the EOC equipped \nwith communication channels (voice & telecopy) to interface with key licensee \nfacilities including the EOF.   \n2.   Wisconsin State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) \nFor emergencies at Prairie Island, the Wisconsin EOC in Madison will be \nactivated and will serve as a command and control center for Wisconsin response \nactivities. The Wisconsin EOC in Madison will coordinate communications with \nthe Pierce County (Wisc) EOC in Ellsworth and the Joint Information Center (JIC) \nin St. Paul, Minnesota. \n3.   County Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) \nThe county EOCs are command and control centers for the local emergency \nresponse organizations. They are located in the following buildings:  \n   Goodhue County Law Enforcement Building.   \n   Dakota County Government Center. \n   Pierce County Emergency Management Office in the Ellsworth Courthouse \nAnnex. \n   Wright County Courthouse. \n   Sherburne County Government Building.   \nThe County EOC receives primary direction from the State EOC and coordinates \nthe local emergency response activities. The agencies assigned responsibilities in \nthe county emergency response organization will provide the required personnel \nto the county EOCs.  \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 16 of 56 \n \n \n4.   Joint Information Center (JIC) \nThe State of Minnesota has established a JIC, which will be activated jointly with \nthe State EOC. The JIC is located in the Saint Paul-Minneapolis area and the \nmajor Minnesota news media are also headquartered in this area. The State of \nWisconsin officials are aware of this arrangement and are prepared to send \nrepresentatives.  \n5.3.4 Communication Links \nThe equipment in each site Emergency Response Facility is specified in their \nEmergency Plans. The equipment in the Backup EOF is described in Attachment 2. \n5.4 Emergency Response \nEmergency response activities performed through the Monticello and Prairie Island \nOffsite Emergency Response Organization are predicated on the fact that each site is \nable to operate independently for several hours during an emergency. Since the Offsite \nEmergency Response Organization can be activated within approximately 2 hours, \nadequate support is available, should the site require it.  \n5.4.1 Activation \n1.    Activation/Site \nThe Shift Manager/Emergency Director is responsible for activating the site \nEmergency Response Organization in accordance with site Emergency Plan \nImplementing Procedures.  A detailed description of the site activation process is \ncontained in the applicable Site Emergency Plan. \n2.  Activation/Offsite \nThe NSPM/Xcel Energy Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite Emergency \nResponse Organization can be activated within about 2 hours of notification. The \nSite Plan Implementing Procedures provide for the notification of the Offsite \nEmergency Response Organization (ERO). The automated Emergency Response \nOrganization Notification System (ERONS) will notify the Offsite ERO in the event \nof a declared emergency in accordance with the Offsite Emergency Plan \nImplementing Procedure. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 17 of 56 \n \n \n5.4.2 Planned Response Action \n1.  Response/Site \nThe Site Emergency Response Organization is activated immediately after the \nShift Manager declares an emergency condition as described in site plans.  At this \ndeclaration, the Shift Manager becomes the Emergency Director until he is \nformally relieved of that responsibility according to the site Emergency Plan \nImplemen\nting Procedures. As Emergency Director, several emergency response \nactions are pre-planned in the site plan and procedures. These actions include \nsteps that initiate the activation process for the site Emergency Response \nOrganization. \n2.    Response/ Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite \nThe Xcel Energy Security Operations Center (SOC) is continuously manned at \nXcel Energy’s General Office.  When notified of an emergency condition, the SOC \nwill initiate the conference call mass notification application(s) to establish a \nmanagement conference call. \nAs part of the site’s ERONS, offsite ERO are also notified who will respond to \ntheir assigned ERF and initiate Offsite Emergency Plan Implementing \nProcedures. The notified personnel have assigned duties that, when \nimplemented, provide for an operational group of personnel at the JIC. \n3.    Response/Vendor/Consultant \nThere are two primary vendors that are involved with emergency response \nplanning for Monticello and Prairie Island Sites. They are: General Electric Co. \n(GE) for Monticello and Westinghouse (W) for Prairie Island. At the request of the \nEmergency Manager, these companies will provide assistance.  \nThe response actions which may be requested involve the following: \n   Personnel \n   Technical analysis \n   Operational analysis \n   Accident/transient analysis \nOther vendors or consultants will be requested to provide assistance as needed. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 18 of 56 \n \n \n4.    Assistance from Other Utilities \nUnder an emergency, it may be desirable to call on the resources (personnel and \nequipment) of other nuclear utilities, outside of NSPM/Xcel Energy. Such a \nrequest may be made by the sites using the INPO Emergency Resource Manual.  \n5.    Response/Support and Resources \nThe Minnesota Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management \n(HSEM) and the Wisconsin Emergency Management (WEM) are the state \nagencies which are responsible for the overall direction of the state emergency \nresponse efforts. The HSEM and WEM will activate their Emergency Operation \nCenters and deploy their personnel and resources, in accordance with the State \nof Minnesota Emergency Operations Plan, and the Wisconsin Emergency \nResponse Plan respectively. These plans include written messages intended for \nthe public which are consistent with the emergency classification scheme and \ngive the public instruction regarding suitable protective action. The Public \nEmergency Planning Education Program (described in Section 5.5) will familiarize \nthe public in the proper response to these pre-planned messages.  \nThe Federal Department of Energy Radiological Assistance Program is available \nfor monitoring assistance and radiological advice to the Minnesota Department of \nHealth (MDH), Section of Radiation Control, and the Wisconsin Department of \nHealth Services (DHS), section of Radiation Protection.   \nThe Department of Energy (DOE) is the coordinating agency for the Federal \nEmergency Response Plan (FERP). Regional Coordinating offices are assigned \ngeographic responsibilities for incidents in their region. Their objective is to rapidly \ndispatch specialists to the incident site, evaluate the hazard, take recommended \naction to counteract and control any acute hazard, and establish communications \nwith local authorities and the press. The Regional Coordinating Offices will \nrespond to requests for radiological assistance from the NSPM/Xcel Energy, \nfederal, state, and local agencies, and would implement the FERP. The \nEmergency Manager will, if necessary, coordinate with the Health Department(s) \nany request for DOE assistance. Federal assistance teams will be supplied \noperating quarters, support, and resources by the State EOC(s).  \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 19 of 56 \n \n \n5.5 Public Information \n5.5.1 Public Emergency Planning Education \nNSPM/Xcel Energy, in coordination with state, county and local officials, annually \nprovides the general public (including transients) with information concerning the \nmethods of public notification and what individual actions should be taken during an \nemergency. This information may include:   \n   methods of public notification \n   possible protective actions \n   general information as to the nature and effects of radiation \n   contact points for additional information \n   special needs for the handicapped \n   registration cards for the mobility impaired. \nMethods for disseminating the information may include calendars, brochures, annual \npublications, public postings and/or meetings. Dissemination of information to the \npublic is coordinated with state and local agencies. \n5.5.2 Media Information \nThe Xcel Energy Communications Department has communications procedures to \nensure prompt communications between Xcel Energy or NSPM and principal media \norganizations.  \nAt least once a year, both states will conduct training programs or send mailings to \nacquaint the news media with the emergency plans and to provide information \nconcerning radiation and points of contact for release of public information in an \nemergency. NSPM/Xcel Energy has input to this process. \nNSPM/Xcel Energy have established procedures for informing the news media when a \nnuclear power plant is removed from service and delineate additional responsibilities \nduring a serious nuclear accident. Primary responsibility for implementation of the \nprogram rests with the Xcel Energy Communications Department after notification by \nthe site. Release of information to the news media and the scheduling of news \nconferences SHALL have the review and concurrence of the Executive Spokesperson.  \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 20 of 56 \n \n \n5.5.3 NSPM/Xcel Energy And Xcel Energy Employee Information \nIt is desirable that NSPM/Xcel Energy employees be aware of the current status during \nan emergency. This ensures employees do not inadvertently start rumors.  Methods of \nemployee communication are delineated in the Communications Program and may \nconsist of the following:   \n   Electronic mail  \n   Public address announcements  \n   Daily news services - print and phone \n   Employee meetings \n5.6 Emergency Organization Interfaces \nThe purpose of this section is to specify communications interfaces between the \nEmergency Response Organization and various organizational entities within and \noutside of NSPM/Xcel Energy. \nAfter notification of an emergency condition is made to offsite officials, the state, and \napplicable county emergency operations centers, the associated response teams will \nbe activated, in accordance with the appropriate State Emergency Plans. Designated \nNSPM/Xcel Energy personnel will make periodic status reports of site conditions to \noffsite officials.  Meteorological data, survey results, projected doses and protective \naction recommendations will be provided to offsite officials. \nThe final decision concerning what protective actions will be implemented on behalf of \nthe public rests with the Governor of each State. Designated Utility officials will make \nrecommendations (see site plans) but the State of Minnesota (and/or Wisconsin & \nPrairie Island Indian Community) is responsible for issuing protective actions decisions \n(PADs). If necessary for a fast developing incident, the States’ Plan provides for the \ncontingency that the site may recommend immediate protective actions to offsite \nofficials. \n5.7 Recovery Phase \nThe process of Recovery Phase is defined in the specific site plans. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 21 of 56 \n \n \n5.8 Exercises, Drills and Training \n5.8.1 Exercises \nPeriodic exercises and drills are conducted to evaluate major portions of emergency \nresponse capabilities, maintain capabilities and identify deficiencies that form the basis \nfor corrective action. These exercises serve to develop and maintain key skills in the \ncourse of emergency response.   \nAn exercise is a real-time simulated event that tests the integrated capability of the \nERO and a major portion of the five basic elements existing within emergency \npreparedness plans. The emergency preparedness exercise simulates an emergency \nthat results in potential offsite radiological releases which would require response by \noffsite authorities.   \nThe five basic elements are: \n1.   Initial Response Activities  \n   Identify and classify emergency \n   Notify and communicate conditions \n   Activate organizations and facilities \n   Control facility access \n2.   Emergency Response Activities \n   Assess accidents \n   Mitigate accidents \n   Recommend protective actions \n3.   Radiological Response Activities \n   Sample/analyze plant air/liquids \n   Monitor onsite radiological conditions \n   Control emergency radiation exposure \n   Monitor offsite radiological conditions \n4.   Assembly and Accountability Activities \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 22 of 56 \n \n \n5.   Offsite Interface Activities \nThe specifics of conducting Emergency Preparedness drills or exercises are found in \nEmergency Preparedness Drill and Exercise Manual. When integrated exercises are \nconducted, the scope will be expanded to also include appropriate State and local \ngovernment agencies as well as the JIC. Each site SHALL exercise with offsite \nauthorities such that the State and local government emergency plans for each \noperating reactor site are exercised at least biennially, with full\n1\n or partial participation\n2\n \nby State(s) and local governments, within the plume exposure pathway EPZ. The level \nof participation SHALL be as follows: \n   At a minimum, each State, within an Ingestion Pathway Zone (IPZ), SHALL \nexercise its plans and preparedness related to ingestion exposure pathway \nmeasures at least once every 8 years. The States of Minnesota and Wisconsin \nshould rotate this participation from between Monticello and Prairie Island sites.  \nLocal governments having ingestion pathway responsibilities should also \nparticipate.  At a minimum, local entities should, during the year the full participation \ningestion exercise is held, review their plans and procedures to verify their \naccuracy and completeness. \n   The Utility should enable any State or local governments, located within the plume \nexposure pathway EPZ, to participate in annual full scale exercises when \nrequested by such State or local government. \nThe need for a remedial exercise under 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2.f \nwill be determined on a case-by-case basis when any of the following conditions \nassociated with a biennial exercise occurs:  \n   Confidentiality is compromised to an extent that broadly affects ERO performance  \n   The scenario does not provide the opportunity for demonstration of key skills; the \nscenario is not implemented in such a way that provides the opportunity for \ndemonstration of key skills. \n                                                \n \n1\n “Full participation” when used in conjunction with emergency preparedness exercises for  \n  a particular site means appropriate offsite local and state authorities and licensee  \n  personnel physically and actively take part in testing their integrated capability to   \n  adequately assess and responded to an accident at a commercial nuclear power plant.  \n  “Full participation” includes testing the major observable portions of the onsite and offsite  \n  emergency plans and mobilization of state, local and licensee personnel and other  \n  resources in sufficient numbers to verify the capability to respond to the accident   \n  scenario. 10 CFR Part 50 Appendixes E, Footnote #4.  \n  \n \n2\n “Partial Participation” when used in conjunction with emergency preparedness exercises  \n  for a particular site means appropriate offsite authorities SHALL actively take part in the  \n  exercise sufficient to test direction and control functions, i.e., (a) protective action  \n  decision making related to emergency action levels, and (b) communication capabilities  \n  among affected state and local authorities and the licensee. 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix  \n  E, Footnote #5   \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 23 of 56 \n \n \n   ERO performance does not provide the NRC with a basis to determine that key \nskills have been maintained. \n   The extent of participation in a remedial exercise will also be determined on a case-\nby-case basis since only portions of the response may need to be re-demonstrated. \nNSPM/Xcel Energy participants in drills and exercises SHALL be assigned from the \nstaff listings in the Nuclear Emergency Preparedness Telephone Directory.   \nControllers in drills and exercises should be trained in the Emergency Response \nOrganization to which they are assigned duties. \nOfficial controllers from Federal, State or local governments will observe, evaluate, and \ncritique the required exercises.  A critique SHALL be scheduled at the conclusion of the \nexercise to evaluate each organization's ability to respond as called for in the \nEmergency Plan.  The critique SHALL be conducted as soon as practicable after the \nexercise, and a formal evaluation should result from the critique.  \nController and participant comments should be evaluated, and corrective actions will \nbe established by management control to ensure that Emergency Plan or \nImplementing Procedures are changed as required. \nThe exercise will be varied from year to year so as to test all major components of the \nplans and preparedness organizations, which may include federal emergency \nresponse agencies, within the applicable exercise cycle (8 years).  Provisions should \nbe made to start a drill or exercise between 6:00pm and 4:00am at least once in every \nexercise cycle. Some drills or exercises should be unannounced. \nThe details concerning scheduling, conduct and critique of drills and exercises are \nspecified in site specific procedures. \n5.8.2 Drills \nA drill is a supervised instruction period aimed at testing, developing and maintaining \nskills in a particular operation.  A drill is often a component of an exercise.  Each drill is \nsupervised and evaluated by a qualified drill coordinator.  The utility will conduct drills \nat intervals specified in site specific procedures and their respective Drill and Exercise \nManual. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 24 of 56 \n \n \n5.8.3 Training \nNSPM/Xcel Energy will assure that radiological emergency response training is \nprovided to those who may be called upon to assist in an emergency. Training will also \nbe provided for the person(s) designated as responsible for the planning effort. \n1.   Qualification of and training for the Monticello and Prairie Island Offsite \nEmergency Response Organization consists of initial overview training and \nposition specific training. The training program for site and EOF ERO members is \ndescribed in the site specific procedures. \n2.

(The independent review \nmay be conducted by either an internal or external organization.)  Individuals who have \nno direct responsibility for implementation of the Emergency Preparedness Program \nwill conduct the review.  The review will include the Emergency Plans, Implementing \nProcedures, training, readiness testing, interface with state and local organizations, \nand equipment.  Management controls will be implemented for evaluation and \ncorrection of review findings.  The result of the review will be documented, reported to \nappropriate organizational management and retained for a period of 6 years.  The part \nof the review involving the evaluation for adequacy of interface with state and local \ngovernments SHALL be made available to the appropriate state and local \ngovernments. \nIn addition, the Utility will review and update plans and procedures as needed and they \nwill be certified to be current on an annual basis. The update will take into account \nchanges identified during drills and exercises. Other reviews of the Emergency Plan \nand Implementing Procedures will be performed as required by Technical \nSpecifications. \n5.9.2 Control of Plans and Procedures \nEmergency Plans and approved changes will be distributed in a controlled manner. \nAssigned copies of state and local plans, required at specific locations within the \nNSPM/Xcel Energy organization, will be updated in the same controlled manner. When \nmaking revisions to the Monticello and Prairie Island Off-site Nuclear Emergency Plan, \nthe section of the plan containing the changes will be revised and issued as a whole. \nThe plan will be marked (side barred) to show where changes have been made. The \nreview, revision and issuance of controlled copies of the Nuclear Emergency Plans will \nbe conducted in accordance with standard Utility procedures for document control. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 27 of 56 \n \n \n5.9.3 Surveillance Program \nA Surveillance Program has been developed to ensure that Monticello and Prairie \nIsland Offsite Nuclear Emergency Plan facilities and procedures are in a current state \nof readiness.  Communication links with federal, state, and county governments are \ntested monthly and inventories of equipment are conducted quarterly. Surveillances \nhave also been prepared to conduct the annual independent review, quarterly \ninventory, and the quarterly updating of emergency response telephone numbers. The \nEmergency Planning Zone (EPZ) brochure/calendar, Ingestion Planning Zone (IPZ) \nbrochure, and handouts for transients are reviewed annually and updated, as needed. \n5.10 Emergency Medical Plan \n5.10.1 Emergency Medical Plan Objective \nThe purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the process to be followed to \nensure that prompt, effective and complete medical assistance is available to a nuclear \npower plant employee in the event of an accident involving an injury or illness which \nmay be complicated by radiation exposure and/or contamination. \nTo provide the best medical treatment possible for its employees, the Utility has made \narrangements with certain off-site medical facilities to care for radiation complicated \ninjuries or illnesses.  Because these facilities have special equipment, expertise and \ntraining, these facilities will be used for this infrequent, but specialized patient care.  \nAny referral of NSPM/Xcel Energy employees outside of this off-site medical system \nwill be done at the direction of the Utility Medical Review Officer, the patient's request, \nthe patient's authorized representative, or per the hospital's mutual aid and transfer \nagreements with hospitals appropriate to the patient needs and acuity. \nFor Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, the principle off-site medical support consists \nof: \n   CentraCare Health EMS (ambulance) Monticello, MN \n   CentraCare Health, Monticello, MN \n   North Memorial Medical Center, Robbinsdale, MN \n   Regions Hospital, St. Paul, MN \n   St. Cloud Hospital (CentraCare) St. Cloud, MN \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 28 of 56 \n \n \nFor Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant the principle off-site medical support \nconsists of: \n   Red Wing Fire and Ambulance Service \n   Mayo Clinic Health System-Red Wing, MN \n   Regions Hospital, St. Paul, MN \n   North Memorial Medical Center, Robbinsdale, MN \n5.10.2 Activation/Plant \n1.   The Shift Manager/Emergency Director is responsible for assessing the extent of \ninjuries, radiation exposure and/or contamination that an individual may have \nreceived during their shift. Their assessment of the personnel, injured with or \nwithout radiation exposure or contamination, is to include the need for offsite \nmedical assistance. The Shift Manager/Emergency Director can use any member \nof the Corporate Medical staff to evaluate the extent of such injuries, if such an \nindividual is available. Additionally, the Shift Manager/Emergency Director can \nuse any available Health Physics expertise to evaluate the victim’s radiation \nexposure or contamination. Once the Shift Manager/Emergency Director has \ndetermined that off-site medical assistance is necessary, it is their responsibility \nto ensure that the local medical hospital and ambulance group are contacted, in \naccordance with the Plant Emergency Implementing Procedures, to arrange for \ntransportation of the victims. \n2.   The Plant Emergency Implementing Procedures describe how the hospital is to \nbe notified and discusses what information the hospital needs to ensure their \nemergency rooms are prepared to receive the potentially \ncontaminated/over-exposed, injured victim. \n5.10.3 Activation/Local Hospital \nThe local hospital or fire department is responsible for the transportation of all \npersonnel from Monticello or Prairie Island Nuclear Generating sites.  They will receive \nall NSPM/Xcel Energy personnel that are injured and/or contaminated and/or have \nreceived an overdose of ionizing radiation.  The local hospital will provide initial medical \ntreatment and decontamination care and, after the patient is stabilized, will arrange, if \nnecessary, the transportation of patients to North Memorial Medical Center, Regions \nHospital, or CentraCare Health St. Cloud via air or ambulance as weather dictates. \nPatients may be transferred directly to a Definitive Care Center if the injury(s) warrant. \nAdditionally, the local hospital could make contact with the Radiation Emergency \nAssistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS) as deemed necessary, to seek further \nmedical advice and expertise. \n\nOffsite Nuclear Emergency Plan  \nRevision: 8 \nFP-EP-PLAN-01 Page 29 of 56 \n \n \n5.10.4 Activation/Definitive Care Center \n1.
